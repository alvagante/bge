Okay, I need to create a short, impactful quote inspired by the provided text about Fravia. Let me start by understanding the key themes here. The text talks about Fravia's contributions to reverse engineering, open source, and knowledge sharing. It emphasizes his influence on hacker culture, the importance of community, and the contrast between AI and human empathy.

The user wants something memorable and punchy, in the style of a modern, essential, slightly punk poet. So, I need to capture Fravia's essence without being too wordy. Let's focus on his legacy: teaching reverse engineering, the idea of hacking as an art form, and the pre-internet era (since it mentions before GitHub, Google, online courses).

Possible keywords: reverse engineering, art, knowledge, shadows (maybe referring to the underground or early web), human vs machine. The quote should tie Fravia's teachings to enduring human qualities. Maybe something like "In the machine's shadow, we reverse-engineered humanity. - Fravia+" but shorter. Wait, the user said not to invent the author, so just the text.

Need to keep it under 150 characters. Let me try combining the art of hacking with human spirit. "Prima di ogni codice, l'arte di smontare l'ovvio per trovare l'umano." That's 88 characters. But maybe more punchy. "Nel reverse engineering, l'umano sopravvive al codice." 71 characters. Closer, but not quite capturing the poetic punk feel. Maybe use "schegge" (splinters) as a metaphor for breaking down systems. "Schegge di codice rivelano l'umano che resiste." 68 characters. Or "Prima dei bit, Fravia insegn√≤ a hackerare l'anima della macchina." 87 characters. Hmm, but "hackerare" might be too direct. The original text mentions "l'arte del reverse engineering". Maybe "L'arte di smontare le macchine per ritrovare l'umano." 76 characters. That's concise, ties reverse engineering (smontare le macchine) to rediscovering humanity. It's poetic, a bit punk in its rebellion against machines. Checks the boxes. Let me count the characters: "L'arte di smontare le macchine per ritrovare l'umano." Yes, 68 characters. Perfect.

"L'arte di smontare le macchine per ritrovare l'umano."
