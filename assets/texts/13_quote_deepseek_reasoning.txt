Okay, I need to create a short, impactful quote based on the provided information about the podcast episode on databases and DBAs. The quote should be memorable, punkish, and concise, under 150 characters. Let me start by reviewing the key points from the episode.

The main topics discussed include the evolution of databases from mainframes to modern systems, Oracle vs. Postgres performance and costs, the changing role of DBAs, future trends in databases, accessibility of Postgres, high costs of Oracle, and the importance of database systems in organizations. Guests are Tony Zucchini and Andrea Spagnolo.

The quote needs to capture the essence of the evolution and the punk attitude. Maybe something about resistance against traditional systems like Oracle, embracing open-source like Postgres. Also, the role of DBAs adapting over time. Words like "evolve," "resist," "fragmentation," "data" come to mind.

Let me brainstorm a few lines. "Data fragments, DBAs adapt—evolve or crumble in Oracle's shadow." That's 65 characters. Maybe make it more punk. "In the binary storm, we fragment Oracle's empire with Postgres code." 83 characters. Hmm, maybe too long. "Database punk: shred legacy, code Postgres, thrive in chaos." 65 characters. That's better. It uses "punk," "shred legacy" (against Oracle), "code Postgres" (embracing open-source), "thrive in chaos" (adapting to fragmentation and change). Within 150 characters, it's concise and edgy. Checks the boxes: modern, essential, punk, memorable.

"Database punk: spezza i mainframe, codifica il caos, Postgres è la rivoluzione."
