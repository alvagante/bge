Okay, I need to create a short, impactful quote based on the provided text about AI's impact on work. The user wants something memorable, modern, poetic, and a bit punk. Let me start by reviewing the key points from the text.

The main themes are the undeniable impact of AI on jobs, the loss of traditional roles, especially creative ones, but also the emergence of new opportunities. There's a focus on adaptation, the blend of human and machine collaboration, ethical concerns, and the unique value of human creativity.

The quote needs to be under 150 characters, so brevity is crucial. I should use vivid imagery and maybe a metaphor. Words like "rivoluzione" (revolution), "sangue" (blood), "silicio" (silicon) come to mind. Maybe contrast human elements with tech terms.

Punk elements could be a rebellious or raw edge. Words like "urlo" (scream) or "resistere" (resist). But it should also hint at coexistence. Maybe something like "We are the blood in the silicon revolution" but in Italian. Let me check the character count: "Siamo il sangue nella rivoluzione del silicio: urliamo codice, resistiamo creativi." That's 74 characters. Wait, maybe "Sangue e silicio: urliamo codice, resistiamo creativi." Even shorter. "Sangue e silicio: urliamo codice, resistiamo creativi." Let's count: 56 characters. That works. It combines human (blood) and tech (silicon), uses "urliamo" (scream) for punk energy, and "resistiamo creativi" to show enduring creativity. Yeah, that fits the themes and style requested.

"Rivoluzione a sangue e silicio: urliamo codice, resistiamo creativi."
