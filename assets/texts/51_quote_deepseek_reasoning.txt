Okay, I need to create a short, impactful quote based on the provided text about how social media affects our daily lives, behaviors, and minds. The user wants something memorable and effective, in the style of a modern, essential, and slightly punk poet. Let me break down the key points from the text to capture the essence.

The main themes are the negative impact on mental health, especially among youth; the role of education and parents; the gap between perception and scientific data; the complexity of human behavior; superficial relationships and social isolation; the need for critical awareness; and the potential for positive use if managed well.

I need to condense these ideas into a concise quote. The punk element suggests a raw, edgy tone. Maybe use metaphors related to technology or the internet. Words like "binary", "soul", "scrolling", "algorithms" could work. Contrast the digital with the human aspect. Keep it under 150 characters.

Let me brainstorm some lines. "Scorriamo anime in codice binario" (We scroll souls in binary code) – captures the digital consumption of human essence. "Frammenti di vita che non ci appartengono" (Fragments of life that don't belong to us) – speaks to superficial interactions. "La connessione è un fantasma che ci disconnette" (Connection is a ghost that disconnects us) – paradox of online vs real connections. "Likes" as bandaids for loneliness. Maybe combine these elements.

Check character count: "Scorriamo anime in codice binario, la connessione è un fantasma che ci disconnette." That's 87 characters in Italian. Add something about likes and loneliness. "I like sono cerotti su ferite di solitudine." Total around 150. Let me check exact count. Yes, it fits. It combines the digital (binary code, connection as a ghost) with the emotional impact (loneliness, disconnection). The metaphor of likes as bandaids is punchy and memorable. The structure is poetic, with a punk edge in the critique of superficial digital interactions. This should work.
