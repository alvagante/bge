Okay, I need to create a short, impactful quote based on the provided text. Let me start by understanding the main themes. The text talks about privacy, data security, the vulnerability of our digital lives, and the constant surveillance we're under. There's a mention of a syllogism that concludes our digital lives aren't safe. The quote needs to be memorable, concise, and have a punk edge.

The user wants something that's essential and profound. Let me look at the key phrases: "Nessun dato online è sicuro," "vita digitale non è sicura," "sorvegliati." Maybe play with the idea of data as something fragile or transient. The original syllogism is structured logically, so the quote should reflect that inevitability but in a poetic way.

Words that come to mind: digital, fragile, evaporate, surveillance, vulnerability. How to combine these into a punchy line? Maybe use a metaphor. "I dati sono lacrime digitali: evaporano nel vento del controllo." Data as tears that evaporate in the wind of control. That's under 150 characters, poetic, and has a punk feel. It captures the vulnerability and the inevitable loss of privacy. Check the character count: "I dati sono lacrime digitali: evaporano nel vento del controllo." Let me count: 73 characters. Perfect. It's evocative and ties into the themes discussed.

"I dati sono lacrime digitali: evaporano nel vento del controllo."
