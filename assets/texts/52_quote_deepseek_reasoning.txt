Okay, so I need to come up with a short citation based on the provided text about AI biases. The user wants something memorable and impactful without adding any comments or attributing it to someone else.

First, let me read through the description again. It's discussing how AI models can inherit biases from their training data, leading to unfair decisions in areas like healthcare and assistance services. The examples given are about representation of disabilities and minorities.

I need a catchy phrase that encapsulates this idea. Maybe something that emphasizes the hidden dangers or unintended consequences of AI based on its training. Words like "hidden dangers," "unintentional," "inequitable," or "disproportionate" could be useful.

Also, it should mention the reliance on data and how biased data can amplify existing prejuices. Perhaps something about relying too much on AI without proper safeguards.

Putting it all together, I want a statement that's concise but conveys the main point: AI's decisions are influenced by its training data, leading to unfair outcomes because of biases.

"La decisioni di una Intelligenza Artificiale sono influenzate da dati potenzialmente distorti, ampliando i pregiudizi esistenti e portando a choice incongruenti con il buon senso."
