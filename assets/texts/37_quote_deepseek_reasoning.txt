Okay, I need to create a short, impactful quote based on the provided text about serverless architectures. Let me start by understanding the main points from the text. The text talks about serverless growth, benefits like scalability, cost efficiency, and challenges like cold starts. The quote should be memorable and capture the essence of serverless.

Hmm, the user wants something from a "poeta moderno, profondo, essenziale e un po' punk." So maybe something edgy but concise. Let's think about metaphors. Serverless is like letting the cloud handle the heavy lifting, but with trade-offs. Maybe something like "Code without chains, but dance on the cloud's edge." Wait, that's not quite right. Need to reflect both freedom and potential instability.

Or focus on the event-driven nature: "In the serverless realm, every event is a revolution—ephemeral, fierce, and free." That's a bit dramatic. Maybe too long. Let's make it snappier. "Code ephemeral, scale eternal." That's short but maybe too vague. 

How about combining the freedom and the challenges? "Serverless: where code burns bright and fast, leaving no server ashes." Hmm, 'server ashes' might not make sense. Maybe 'leaving no trace'? No, not quite. 

Wait, the original text mentions not worrying about the systems. So maybe something about liberation from infrastructure. "Serverless is the anarchist's cloud—code ignites, servers vanish." Anarchist fits the punk vibe. "Ignites" for events triggering functions. Yeah, that's catchy and has the punk edge.

"Serverless è il cloud degli anarchici: il codice brucia, i server evaporano."
