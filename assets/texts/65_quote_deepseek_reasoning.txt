Okay, I need to create a short, impactful quote based on the provided text. The user wants something memorable and effective, in the style of a modern, essential, and slightly punk poet. Let's break down the key themes from the episode description and the topics covered.

The main points are: Italy's telecom infrastructure post-TIM sale to KKR, the state of mobile and fixed networks, technologies like fiber, copper, wireless, 5G challenges, infrastructure sharing, electromagnetic exposure limits, future of telecom in Italy.

The quote needs to capture the tension between old and new, perhaps the struggle of Italy's networks under foreign ownership, or the clash between technological progress and bureaucratic/regulatory constraints. Since it's a bit punk, maybe something edgy, using metaphors related to infrastructure, like wires, signals, control.

Possible angles: the sale as a loss of control, the web of infrastructure, 5G's potential vs. limitations. Words like "veins", "pulse", "shackles", "static", "frequencies".

Let me brainstorm some lines. Maybe something like: "Nelle vene di rame scorre il futuro, ma il segnale si perde tra le ceneri del monopolio." (In copper veins flows the future, but the signal fades in the ashes of monopoly.) That references the copper infrastructure and the sale/monopoly issues.

Or: "Il 5G grida libertà, ma i limiti sono fili spinati nel vento." (5G screams freedom, but the limits are barbed wires in the wind.) Touches on 5G and exposure limits as barriers.

Another idea: "Vendiamo le autostrade digitali, e navigheremo a pedaggio." (We sell the digital highways, and we'll navigate by toll.) Comments on the sale to a financial entity leading to tolls or controlled access.

Need to keep it under 150 characters. Check the character count. Let's try: "Vendemmo le autostrade digitali, ora navigare è un pedaggio." (We sold the digital highways, now surfing is a toll.) That's 67 characters in Italian. Maybe more poetic: "Nella rete venduta, il futuro è un byte in ostaggio." (In the sold network, the future is a hostage byte.) 62 chars.

Alternatively, combining infrastructure and punk vibe: "Il 5G è un pugno al cielo, ma l'Italia lo incatena al passato." (5G is a fist to the sky, but Italy chains it to the past.) 82 chars.

The user wants it to be essential and memorable. Maybe a metaphor about infrastructure as veins or roots. "Le radici di rame non reggono il vento del 5G." (Copper roots can't hold the 5G wind.) 61 chars.

Or more abstract: "Dove il monopolio scolora il segnale, il futuro è interferenza." (Where monopoly fades the signal, the future is interference.) 85 chars.

Need to pick the one that's punchy, combines key elements (sale, infrastructure, tech, constraints). The first one about selling digital highways and tolls might hit the right note. Let me check: "Vendemmo le autostrade digitali, ora navigare è un pedaggio." 67 characters. Yes, that's concise, uses metaphor, and comments on the sale's impact (toll = cost/control). It's a bit punk in criticizing privatization. I think that works.
