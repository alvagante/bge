Okay, so I need to come up with a citation based on the provided text about the Italian IT infrastructure after TIM's sale. The user wants it in the style of a modern poet who is deep and essential but also has a punk edge.

First, I'll read through the description again: It talks about the current and future state of IT infrastructures in Italy, especially after TIM was sold to KKR. They mention Stefano Bolis and some extinct geeks involved.

I should capture the essence without being too technical. Maybe use metaphors related to networks or connections. Punk elements could include a rebellious or energetic tone.

Thinking about the structure: It needs to be concise but impactful, like a short poem with vivid imagery. Perhaps something that symbolizes the resilience of IT infrastructure despite changes in ownership.

I'll brainstorm some words and phrases: network ties, data flow, cables, future, resilience, punk energy, etc. Try to weave these into a coherent, memorable line.

Maybe start with something about the cables or connections being alive after the sale. Then touch on how they're still functioning but maybe with new twists due to the sale. End with a statement that reflects on the future and the ongoing struggles in IT infrastructure.

Putting it all together: "Cable ties alive, data flows free, / Through broken wires, we still cope. / After TIM's fall, the network thrives, / A punk anthem for resilience." 

This seems to fitâ€”alive cables, data flow, acknowledging the past sale but highlighting continued functionality and a rebellious spirit towards resilience.

"Cable ties alive, data flows free,  
Through broken wires, we still cope.  
After TIM's fall, the network thrives,  
A punk anthem for resilience."
