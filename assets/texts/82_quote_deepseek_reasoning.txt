Okay, I need to create a short, impactful quote based on the provided text about the NIS2 directive. Let me start by understanding the key themes here. The main points are the NIS2 directive's requirements for companies and their suppliers, the dual perspectives of seeing it as an opportunity for resilience versus bureaucratic paperwork, the responsibility of C-level executives, and the emphasis on cybersecurity culture, collaboration, and resilience.

The user wants a memorable quote from a modern, essential, and slightly punk poet. So, the language should be sharp, maybe a bit rebellious, but still profound. I should avoid being too technical. Let me brainstorm some metaphors. The directive is about security as armor, but also about shared responsibility. Words like "armatura" (armor) or "catena" (chain) come to mind. Maybe contrast the digital coldness with human elements.

The original Italian text mentions "resilienza," "processi," "responsabilità," and "fornitori." The quote needs to tie these together. Perhaps something like turning compliance into strength, making the chain of suppliers into a united front. Using words with a bit of edge, like "cyber sangue freddo" (cyber cold blood) to contrast with human warmth. Or "resilienza" as both a shield and a shared burden.

Let me try a few combinations. Maybe start with "Nella giungla digitale..." to set the scene. Then mention armor made of resilience and shared responsibility. "L'armatura è resilienza e responsabilità condivisa: ogni anello della catena è un patto di sopravvivenza." That's 144 characters. Checks the boxes: mentions resilience, shared responsibility, the supply chain as links in a survival pact. It's poetic, uses metaphor, and has a punkish edge with "giungla digitale" and "patto di sopravvivenza."

Let me double-check the character count. Yes, under 150. The themes from the text are all there: the directive's requirements, the chain of suppliers, the dual opportunity/burden, C-level responsibility framed as a shared pact. The contrast between digital challenges and human collaboration. Yeah, this should work.
