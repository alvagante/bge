Okay, so I need to come up with a short citation based on the provided text about NIS2 directive and its implications. The user wants it to be memorable and impactful without assigning an author. Let me break this down.

First, the text talks about NIS2 being active, introducing operative continuity and safety obligations for certain companies (Essential and Important Subjects) and their suppliers. It mentions that while C-levels find it a significant challenge, others see it as just another formality. The episode also covers the broader impact on IT security, compliance, disaster recovery, and supply chain resilience.

I should capture the essence: NIS2 is pushing companies to enhance their IT security posture, ensuring continuity of operations even in face of threats or disruptions. It's about being proactive rather than reactive. Maybe something like "NIS2 enforces a proactive stance on IT security for critical entities." That seems concise and memorable.

Wait, does that cover all aspects? It mentions continuity, safety obligations, and resilience but might not touch on the C-level aspect as much. Perhaps better to include resilience: "NIS2 mandates a resilient IT strategy for key organizations ensuring operational continuity despite cyber threats."

Hmm, maybe combining both ideas. "Under NIS2, critical businesses must adopt a resilient IT strategy to ensure operational continuity in the face of cyber threats." That's shorter and captures the proactive nature.

Alternatively, "NIS2 pushes companies to prioritize IT security for sustained business resilience against evolving cyber risks." This emphasizes resilience and addresses the evolving threat landscape.

I think I'll go with the first version: "NIS2 requires critical businesses to adopt a resilient IT strategy ensuring operational continuity despite cyber threats."

But wait, maybe it's better to make it more concise. How about "NIS2 mandates a resilient IT approach for key organizations to maintain business continuity amid cyber threats." That's shorter and still conveys the necessary points.

I think that works.
