Okay, I need to create a short, impactful quote based on the provided text. The user wants something memorable and punchy, in the style of a modern, essential, and slightly punk poet. Let's start by reviewing the key points from the episode summary.

The main themes are open source in IT education, evolving technologies, AI's role in learning, continuous adaptation, knowledge sharing, changing teaching methods, and reflections on future AI impact. The guests are all involved in open source education and advocacy, so the quote should tie into collaboration, open knowledge, and resilience against rapid tech changes.

The user mentioned "un po' punk," so maybe a rebellious or defiant tone. Words like "code," "minds," "future," "open," "resist," "machines" could work. Need to keep it under 150 characters.

Let me brainstorm some phrases. Combining open source with human spirit. Maybe something about code being more than machines, or minds staying open. "Nella rete del codice, i ribelli aprono menti: il futuro è open source o non è." Wait, that's 130 characters. Or "Codice aperto, menti ribelli: il futuro si scrive condiviso, non clonato." Hmm, maybe too long. Let's check character count. "Codice aperto, menti ribelli: il futuro è condiviso, non clonato." That's 91 characters. Good. It captures the open source (codice aperto), rebellious minds (menti ribelli), and the idea of a shared future versus cloned (AI-generated?), which ties into the AI discussion. The punk aspect is in the rebellion and resistance to cloning, perhaps against AI taking over. Yeah, this works. It's concise, memorable, and hits the required themes.

"Codice aperto, menti ribelli: il futuro è condiviso, non clonato."
