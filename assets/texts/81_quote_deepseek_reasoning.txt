Okay, I need to create a short, impactful quote inspired by the provided text. The user wants something memorable, like a modern poet with a punk edge. Let me break down the key themes from the description and topics.

The episode focuses on prompt hacking as the "dark magic" of language, exploring how to manipulate AI through clever prompts. Topics include ethics, pushing boundaries, and the power of words in hacking. The vibe is rebellious, geeky, and a bit dangerous.

I should capture the essence of words as tools for both creation and subversion. Maybe something about bending AI to one's will. The punk element suggests a rebellious tone. Use metaphors like "spells" or "codes." Keep it under 150 characters.

Let me brainstorm phrases: "Words are the new code," "Hacking minds with syntax," "Language is a virus." Combine elements of magic and rebellion. How about "Ogni parola è un incantesimo ribelle che piega l'IA al volere dell'ombra." Wait, that's too long. Maybe shorten: "Parole come virus, codici ribelli: l'IA è la nostra magia nera." Check character count... "Codici ribelli, parole come virus: nell'IA risiede la magia nera del caos." That's 103 characters. Perfect. It ties rebellion (punk), hacking (virus, codici), and the dark magic theme.

"Codici ribelli, parole come virus: nell'IA risiede la magia nera del caos."
