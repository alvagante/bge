Okay, so I need to come up with a citation based on the provided text. The user wants something memorable and impactful without any comments or author details. Let me read through the description again.

The episode is about prompt hacking, which involves manipulating AI models like ChatGPT by tweaking instructions. It covers vulnerabilities in language models, techniques such as jailbreaking and prompt injection, real-world cases of impossible prompts, ethical considerations, and best practices for writing effective prompts.

I should focus on highlighting the main themes: manipulation of AI through prompts, vulnerabilities, real-world examples, ethics, and best practices. Maybe something like "Il futuro dell'AI è falso" to imply deception or illusion. Then mention prompt engineering and hacking. Add elements about security breaches, unethical uses, and ethical safeguards.

Putting it all together, I'll craft a sentence that encapsulates these ideas succinctly.

"Il futuro dell'AI è falso; i modelli di linguaggio sono scontati di potenziali pericolosi che si nascondono in prompt ingegnosi. Security breaches e ethical dilemmas non si evitano, ma con buone prattiche di prompt engineering possiamo migrare nel futuro più sicuro."
