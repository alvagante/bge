Okay, I need to create a short, impactful quote based on the provided text about the CrowdStrike Falcon update disaster. Let me start by understanding the key themes here. The main points are the fragility of digital systems, the human factor in tech failures, and the cascading effects of a single update. The quote should be memorable, concise, and have a punk edge.

First, I need a metaphor that ties the digital fragility to something tangible. "Digital pillars of salt" could reference the biblical story of Lot's wife turning into salt, symbolizing fragility and collapse. Then, connect it to the human aspect: "crumble under the weight of a single line of code" emphasizes how minor errors can cause massive issues. Ending with a warning about human fallibility in tech makes it poignant. Let me check the character count to ensure it's under 150. Yep, that works. It captures the essence without mentioning the author, just the message.

"Digitali colonne di sale: crollano sotto il peso d’un codice, monito eterno d’umanità fallibile in mondi d’acciaio."
