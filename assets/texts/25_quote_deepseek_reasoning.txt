Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this. The user wants a short, impactful quote in Italian based on the provided text. The text talks about the evolution from system administrators managing OS to writing infrastructure code with tools like Terraform, Kubernetes, etc. They mention the shift from manual to automated processes and the blend of coding and infrastructure.

The quote needs to be memorable, punkish, modern, and concise (under 150 characters). I should capture the essence of transformation from hands-on systems work to coding infrastructure. Maybe use a metaphor that combines machinery with code. Words like "sangue" (blood), "codice" (code), "ferro" (iron), "cloud" could work. Let me play with the structure. How about something like "Non più sudore su server, ma codice che forgia nuvole. L'infrastruttura è poesia punk." Wait, that's 122 characters. Checks the boxes: mentions the shift from physical servers to code, uses "nuvole" for cloud, and ends with "punk poetry" to give it that edge. Maybe tweak for more punch. "Da sistemi a codice: il nostro sudore ora è bit che danza tra ferro e cloud." Hmm, longer. Need to be more concise. "Non sangue sui server, ma codice che canta tra ferro e nuvole. Infrastruttura è poesia." That's 128 characters. Uses contrasting elements (blood vs code, iron vs clouds) and ends with poetry. "Codice è il nuovo ferro, il cloud la nostra fucina. DevOps: poesia punk." 105 chars. Combines code as the new iron, cloud as forge, and DevOps as punk poetry. Maybe that's better. Let me check the original themes again to ensure alignment. The transition from manual systems work to automated code, tools like Terraform, Kubernetes, infrastructure as code. The quote should reflect that shift and the blend of technology (code, cloud) with a rebellious or poetic twist. "Codice è il nuovo ferro, cloud la fucina. DevOps: poesia punk." 94 characters. Yes, that's tight and hits the key points. "Codice" as the new "ferro" (iron, implying the old hardware), "cloud" as the forge, and "DevOps: punk poetry" as the essence. It's catchy, fits the punk vibe, and is memorable. Checks all boxes.
