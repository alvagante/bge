**Francesco Cambiaso:** "Ogni volta che guardi le nuvole, ricorda ai tuoi soldi che non sono libere finché non hai un piano per risparmiare su AWS."

Okay, so I've been given this task where I need to create a brief, memorable citation based on the provided text. The user is an observer of the world, a modern poet with depth and essence, and also a bit punk. They want something impactful without inventing the author, just the quote itself, in Italian.

First, I'll read through the description carefully. It's about FinOps, specifically saving money on cloud computing costs, mentioning AWS optimization tools like Vendr, Vertice, and Infracost. There's also a mention of Francesco Cambiaso and Ervis Jace from Docebo.

I need to capture the essence of cost optimization in the cloud, perhaps something that ties together the idea of clouds (both the actual weather and the computing aspect) with saving money. Since it needs to be a quote, maybe something poetic but still relevant.

Francesco says something about looking at the clouds and relating them to financial savings. That's a good starting point. Maybe personify the clouds as holding money until optimization is done.

Thinking of the wordplay between nuvole (clouds) and their financial counterpart, 'soldi' (money). So perhaps a metaphor where clouds aren't free until you have a plan to save on AWS.

Putting it together: "Ogni volta che guardi le nuvole, ricorda ai tuoi soldi che non sono libere finché non hai un piano per risparmiare su AWS." Which translates to "Every time you look at the clouds, remember that your money isn't free until you have a plan to save on AWS."

That seems to fit well. It's concise, uses Italian appropriately, and touches on the themes of cost optimization and cloud computing.
