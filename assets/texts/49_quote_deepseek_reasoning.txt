Okay, I need to create a short, impactful quote based on the provided text about FinOps and cloud cost optimization. Let's start by identifying the main themes from the episode. The key points are saving money in cloud computing, avoiding waste, efficiency, tools like Kubernetes and Infracost, and a frugal mindset.

The quote needs to be memorable, concise, and a bit punk. Maybe use a metaphor related to the cloud. Words like "sculpting" or "carving" could work. "Nuvole" (clouds) and "sprechi" (waste) are important. Need to keep it under 150 characters.

First attempt: "Scolpiamo nuvole, non sprechi: nel cloud ogni byte è un tesoro sepolto." Let me check the character count. "Scolpiamo nuvole, non sprechi: nel cloud ogni byte è un tesoro sepolto." That's 90 characters. Good. It uses sculpting as a metaphor, contrasts clouds (nuvole) with waste (sprechi), and mentions bytes as buried treasure, tying into cost optimization. It's punchy and fits the punk, modern poet vibe.

"Nuvole scolpite, non sprechi: nel cloud ogni byte è oro sepolto da disotterrare."
