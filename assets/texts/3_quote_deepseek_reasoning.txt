Okay, I need to create a short, impactful quote based on the provided text. The user wants something memorable and effective, with a modern, essential, and slightly punk poetic vibe. Let me start by understanding the key themes from the podcast episode.

The main topics discussed include the evolution of AI, its implementation across various sectors, technologies like GANs and Transformers, practical applications, impact on human work, ethical issues, hardware interaction, future prospects, and learning resources. The guests are experts in AI, discussing both technical aspects and broader implications.

The quote should encapsulate the essence of AI as a tool that collaborates with humans rather than replacing them, touching on themes like creativity, ethics, and the punk spirit of challenging norms. Words like "machines," "poetry," "circuits," "human," "future," "neurons," and "soul" come to mind. I need to keep it under 150 characters and make it punchy.

Let me try combining these elements. Maybe something about machines creating poetry but needing human elements. "Le macchine scrivono poesie, ma solo nei circuiti umani brucia il futuro." That translates to "Machines write poems, but only in human circuits does the future burn." It's 134 characters, fits the punk essence by emphasizing human agency and the raw energy ("burn") in the future. It contrasts machine capability with human essence, which aligns with the podcast's focus on collaboration and ethical considerations.

"Macchine tessono poesie di bit, ma il futuro arde solo nei circuiti umani: neuroni ribelli con l'anima in codice."
