Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants a short, impactful quote in Italian, inspired by the provided text about AI and art. The quote needs to be memorable, punkish, and profound.

First, the key themes from the text: AI's role in art, ethical questions, the struggle of human artists, the fear of replacement, and the essence of human creativity versus algorithms. The quote should encapsulate the tension between human creativity and AI.

The user mentioned a "modern poet, essential and a bit punk." So the language should be edgy, concise, maybe with a rebellious tone. Let's brainstorm some metaphors. Maybe something about machines and souls? Or humans vs algorithms.

Looking at the existing points: "L'arte è umana finché brucia algoritmi per riscaldarsi." That's from the example. Wait, but the user wants an invented one, not the example. So avoid that. Think original.

Possible angles: Human imperfection vs AI precision. The soul in art. Rebellion against machines. Maybe something like "L’arte è rivolta quando un pixel sfida l’algoritmo." (Art is rebellion when a pixel defies the algorithm.) Short, has contrast, punk spirit.

Or "Nessun codice può contenere l’anima di un gesto umano." (No code can contain the soul of a human gesture.) Hits on the human element vs AI.

Check character count. Let's see: "Nell'occhio della macchina, l'arte umana brucia come un virus ribelle." (In the machine's eye, human art burns like a rebel virus.) 108 characters. Memorable, punk, uses metaphor of virus as rebellion. Combines the machine perspective with human art's defiance.

Yes, that captures the essence. It's vivid, contrasts the cold machine with the fiery, rebellious human art. Fits the punk, essential style. Checks the boxes.
