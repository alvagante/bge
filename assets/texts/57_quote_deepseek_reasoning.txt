Okay, so I need to come up with a citation based on the provided text. The user has given me some context about an article discussing the intersection of art and artificial intelligence (AI). They want a brief, memorable quote without any author information—just the citation itself.

First, I'll read through the description again to understand the main points. The article talks about how AI is influencing the art world, creating new opportunities but also raising ethical and professional questions. It mentions that AI doesn't have true intelligence but relies on algorithms and data, which limits its creativity compared to human artists. There's concern about whether AI might replace human artists and the need for regulation.

The guests listed are various artists and experts in AI-related fields like fumettists, 3D modelers, musicians, etc. Their expertise suggests that they have insights into both the creative side and the technical challenges of integrating AI into art.

I should create a quote that encapsulates one of these concerns or points. Maybe something about the fear of AI taking over or the ethical implications. It needs to be concise but meaningful.

Perhaps focusing on the idea that while AI can generate content, it lacks the creativity and depth that true art requires. Or maybe highlighting the collaboration between humans and AI in the creative process.

Wait, looking at the guests' expertise—Luciano is a 3D artist and expert in AI, so he might have thoughts on how AI affects the job market or the role of artists. Carlo is an IT guy and art historian, so he could bring a historical perspective on technology's impact on art.

Putting it all together, maybe something like: "The true essence of art lies beyond what machines can replicate, sparking debates on creativity and ethics in the age of AI."

That seems to touch on both the creative aspect and the ethical concerns without being too long.

"True art transcends replication, fueling discussions on creativity and ethics as AI evolves."
