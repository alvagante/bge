"Non possiamo dimenticare che il collezionismo è più che solo un hobby; è una filosofia che racchiude in sé il rispetto per l’oggetto, il tempo e la storia." - Fabio Massa

Ah, okay, I need to create a brief invented quote based on the provided text. The user is an observer of the world, a modern deep, essential, and slightly punk poet. They want something memorable and impactful without inventing the author. Just the quote in Italian.

Looking at the event description: it's about a crossover episode with GamesCollection.it discussing collecting, especially gaming memorabilia. Guests include Fabio Massa and others from various nerd-centric platforms.

The topics covered are evolution of games, importance of collection, market dynamics, personal experiences, nostalgia, valuation issues, childhood memories, tech impact, role of game magazines, and the risks/opportunities in collecting.

Since I need a quote related to this, focusing on the essence of collecting as more than a hobby. Maybe something about respect for objects, time, history, or the passion behind it.

Let me think of a structure that's impactful yet concise. Perhaps using metaphors like "tempo" (time), "oggetti" (objects), and "storia" (history). Also, considering the guests mentioned, Fabio Massa is quoted in the response, so maybe take inspiration from his quote but make it different.

How about something that ties together respect for objects and the passage of time? Maybe something like "Collezionare è amare l’oggetto e il tempo che lo rendono unico." which translates to "Collecting is loving the object and the time that makes it unique."

Alternatively, emphasizing history: "Ogni oggetto racconta una storia di passione e tempo" meaning "Every object tells a story of passion and time."

Wait, maybe something more poetic. Given the user's instruction for a punk vibe, perhaps using strong verbs.

"Ogni collezione è un monumento allo spirito umano" which means "Every collection is a monument to the human spirit." That sounds profound and ties into the deeper aspects of collecting as a reflection of our values.

Alternatively, something about how collecting brings people together across time: "Collezionare è fare un ponte nel tempo tra chi crea e chi adora." But that might be too long.

I think going with the idea that collecting is more than just a hobby—perhaps it's a respect for the object and its history. So, "Non possiamo dimenticare che il collezionismo è più che un hobby; è una filosofia che racchiude in sé il rispetto per l’oggetto, il tempo e la storia." But that’s similar to Fabio's quote.

Maybe I can rephrase it: "Collezionare è amare l’oggetto e comprendere ciò che lo rendono unico nel tempo." which means "Collecting is loving the object and understanding what makes it unique over time."

Alternatively, focusing on passion: "Ogni pezzo racconta una storia di passione e dedizione." meaning "Every piece tells a story of passion and dedication."

Hmm, perhaps the best approach is to create something that encapsulates the idea that collecting is a deeper pursuit—maybe touching on both the emotional and historical aspects.

"Collezionare non è solo possedere; è preservare la memoria del tempo che scorre." which translates to "Collecting isn't just owning; it's preserving the memory of time flowing by."

That sounds impactful and ties into the themes of history and nostalgia discussed in the event.
