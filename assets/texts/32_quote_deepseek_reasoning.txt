Okay, let's see. The user wants a short, memorable quote inspired by the provided text. The text is about programming languages in 2023, how they evolve, and the importance of adaptability. The quote should be original, punchy, and not mention any author.

Hmm, the key themes here are evolution, adaptability, the rise of new languages, and the cloud-native/AI context. Words like "mutano", "evolvono", "cloud native", "AI" stand out. Need something that captures the transient nature of tech but the enduring need for learning.

Maybe start with a metaphor. Like comparing programming languages to something ephemeral but impactful. "I linguaggi sono nuvole" – languages are clouds, which fits the cloud-native mention. Then contrast with the coder's mind as the sky, vast and adaptable. "Il codice è vento" – code is wind, ever-changing. Ends with "solo la curiosità è radice" – curiosity as the root, the constant. That has a poetic ring, ties the elements together, and emphasizes continuous learning. Check if it's concise and impactful. Yeah, that works.

"I linguaggi sono nuvole, il cervello del programmatore è il cielo.  
Il codice è vento che muta direzione,  
solo la curiosità è radice."
