Okay, so I need to create a short and memorable quote based on the provided text about software evolution. The user wants it without an author mentioned, just the citation.

First, I'll read through the description again to get the main points: It's discussing the evolution of software architecture over eight years, touching on monolithic systems transitioning to microservices, the role of architects, adaptability, programming languages, no-code movements, serverless solutions, balancing technical decisions with economics, and staying updated in IT.

I should capture the essenceâ€”how architecture is evolving and its importance. Maybe something about transformation or evolution. Since it's a quote from a presentation, it could be inspirational but concise.

Let me try to condense that into one line. Perhaps focusing on change and innovation: "L'architettura software si trasforma, ad ogni new frontend e microservizi." That translates to "The software architecture transforms with every new frontend and microservices."

I think that captures the evolution aspect and is memorable.

"La architettura del software si trasforma con ogni nuova frontend e microservizio."
