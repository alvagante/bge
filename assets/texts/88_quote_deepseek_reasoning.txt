Okay, so I need to write a citation based on the provided text about the European Accessibility Act. The user wants something memorable and impactful without assigning an author. Let me see... The main points are that the EAA will require digital accessibility for software, websites, and services by June 28, 2025. It affects businesses, developers, designers, etc., with new standards, testing tools like Lighthouse, and implications for inclusivity.

I should highlight the urgency, the impact on users and companies, and maybe touch on preparation or changes needed. Maybe start with a strong statement about adapting to new laws, then mention the key areas affected: legal obligations, design for all, user experience, etc. End with a call to action or the importance of this change.

Let me structure it in a way that flows well, using terms like "Adapting to New Legal Standards," "Ensuring Digital Inclusivity," and "Preparing for Future Challenges." I'll make sure it's concise but covers all the main aspects without being too lengthy.

"Adapting to New Legal Standards: The European Accessibility Act (EAA) Mandates Digital Inclusivity, mandating June 28, 2025, as the deadline for implementing digital accessibility across software, websites, and services. This pivotal shift underscores the importance of designing user-friendly solutions that cater to all users, including those with disabilities, thereby fostering a more inclusive digital landscape."
