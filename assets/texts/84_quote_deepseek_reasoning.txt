Okay, I need to create a short, impactful quote based on the provided text. The user wants something memorable and effective, in the style of a modern, essential, somewhat punk poet. Let me start by understanding the main themes of the episode.

The episode discusses the digital age's disinformation, fake news, fact-checking's inefficacy, confirmation bubbles, deepfakes, and the questioning of objective truth. The key question is whether objective truth ever existed or if we're in a perpetual conflict between beliefs and manipulation.

I need to condense these ideas into a brief quote. Maybe focus on the idea that truth is a construct or illusion. Words like "illusion," "constructed," "war of mirrors" could work. The quote should be punchy, with a poetic yet punk edge. Let me play with metaphors related to mirrors or shadows to represent distorted realities. How about something like "La verità è un'illusione che si dissolve in una guerra di specchi e ombre digitali." Checking the character count: "La verità è un'illusione che si dissolve in una guerra di specchi e ombre digitali." That's under 150 characters. It captures the ephemeral nature of truth and the digital conflict, using "specchi" (mirrors) for reflections/echo chambers and "ombre digitali" for deepfakes or digital distortions. Sounds good.

"La verità è un'illusione che si dissolve in una guerra di specchi e ombre digitali."
