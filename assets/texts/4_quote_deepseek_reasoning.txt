Okay, I need to create a short, impactful quote based on the provided text. Let me start by understanding the key themes from the podcast episode. The main topics discussed are Infrastructure as Model, the complexity of IT infrastructure, the importance of physical networking, new tools like Nix, debates on current technologies, challenges with managed platforms, comparisons of methodologies, career reflections, and the motivational impact of conferences.

The user wants a quote that's memorable, punchy, and in the style of a modern, essential, slightly punk poet. It should be under 150 characters. Let me focus on the central ideas. The shift from static configurations to dynamic ecosystems (Infrastructure as Model) stands out. Also, the tension between human interaction in networking versus online tools, and the evolution of technology practices.

How to condense these into a poetic line? Maybe contrast the technical with the human. Words like "circuits" for tech, "flesh" for human elements. The idea of systems being alive rather than static. "Infrastructures are poems of circuits and flesh" â€“ that combines tech (circuits) with human (flesh) in a poetic way. Then add something about them being alive and ungovernable. "Alive, ungovernable: the future beats in analog pulses." "Ungovernable" adds a punk edge, and "analog pulses" ties back to the physical networking aspect. Let me check the character count:

"Infrastructures are poems of circuits and flesh. Alive, ungovernable: the future beats in analog pulses."

Counting the characters: "Infrastructures are poems of circuits and flesh. Alive, ungovernable: the future beats in analog pulses." Let me check:

First part: "Infrastructures are poems of circuits and flesh." That's 53 characters. Second part: "Alive, ungovernable: the future beats in analog pulses." 55 characters. Total with space and period: 53 + 55 + 3 (space, colon, period?) Wait, original quote as written: the user example uses a period after first sentence, then a colon. Let me recount:

"Infrastructures are poems of circuits and flesh. Alive, ungovernable: the future beats in analog pulses."

Each part:

First sentence: "Infrastructures are poems of circuits and flesh." That's 52 characters (including space and period). Second sentence: "Alive, ungovernable: the future beats in analog pulses." Let's see: "Alive, ungovernable: the future beats in analog pulses." 56 characters. Total with the period and space: 52 + 1 (space) + 56 = 109, which is under 150. Okay, fits. It captures the blend of technology and human elements, the dynamic nature (alive, ungovernable), and the analog pulses reference both the physical networking and the heartbeat of future tech. The punk vibe comes through in "ungovernable" and the rebellious tone against static systems. This should work.

"Infrastrutture sono poesie di circuiti e carne. Vivono, indomite: il futuro pulsa in segnali analogici."
