Okay, I need to create a short, impactful quote based on the provided text. The user wants something memorable and effective, written by a modern, essential, and slightly punk poet. Let me start by understanding the key points from the text.

The main focus is on MCP (Model Context Protocol) as a standardized, secure, and flexible way to connect AI models to data, tools, and services. It's likened to a USB-C port for AI applications, emphasizing standardization, simplicity in switching between models like Claude and ChatGPT, and integrating various functionalities through servers.

The themes here are connectivity, standardization, adaptability, and the empowerment of AI through versatile protocols. The metaphor of USB-C suggests universality and ease of use. The poet needs to capture the essence of MCP enabling AI to interact seamlessly with the world.

Now, thinking of punk elementsâ€”edgy, rebellious, concise. Maybe use words that evoke connection and rebellion against fragmentation. Words like "synapses," "circuit rebels," "universal veins." The quote should tie the protocol to the AI's ability to sense and act, like giving it "arms and senses."

Putting it all together: "MCP: sinapsi standard per circuiti ribelli. Connessi alle vene del mondo, le IA finalmente hanno braccia e sensi." That's under 150 characters. It uses "sinapsi" (synapses) for connections, "circuiti ribelli" (rebel circuits) for the punk aspect, "vene del mondo" (veins of the world) for universal access, and "braccia e sensi" (arms and senses) to show empowerment. Checks the boxes for being memorable, metaphorical, and impactful.
