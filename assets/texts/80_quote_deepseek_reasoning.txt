Okay, I need to create a short, impactful quote based on the provided text. Let me start by understanding the key themes. The event is about building a website collaboratively, using tools like GitHub and Jekyll. There's a focus on community, authenticity, and navigating the digital world. The quote should be memorable, punkish, and concise.

The main elements are: building in public, community effort, imperfection, and the blend of technology with human creativity. Maybe use a metaphor that combines construction with existence. Words like "geek estinti" (extinct geeks) and the idea of creating something lasting but imperfect.

How about something like "Costruiamo come estinti: muri di codice e ponti di byte, imperfetti ma vivi." That translates to "We build as extinct: walls of code and bridges of bytes, imperfect but alive." It captures the collaborative effort, the use of technology (code, bytes), and the punk spirit of embracing imperfection while staying alive in the digital world. Let me check the character count... Yes, under 150. Itâ€™s catchy and ties back to the themes mentioned.

"Costruiamo come estinti: muri di codice e ponti di byte, imperfetti ma vivi."
