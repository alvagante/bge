"Chi dice che l'IT è un dungeon? Diciamo di chiamarlo 'il cervello del mondo', finché nessuno lo capisce."

Okay, so I need to come up with a brief invented quote based on the provided text. The user wants something memorable and impactful, not inventing the author, just the citation in Italian.

First, I'll review the content. It's about the second episode of "Brigata dei geek estinti," focusing on IT in finance, DevOps, cloud, etc. The guests discuss automation, tools like Puppet and Ansible, transition to immutable infrastructure, compliance challenges, balancing control with agility, code release efficiency, cloud-native architecture, sustainability of mutable infrastructures, future of IT, and the need for skilled personnel.

The key points are: importance of automation in IT, use of specific tools, moving to immutable infrastructure for scalability, banking sector challenges regarding compliance and operational speed, balanced approach between control and agility, efficiency in code releases, impact of cloud-native architecture and containers, discussions on sustaining mutable infrastructures, reflections on future IT practices, and the need for qualified personnel.

The user wants a quote from an observer, a modern poet with depth, essentiality, and a bit of punk. So the quote should be concise, impactful, maybe a play on words related to IT or finance.

Looking at Piergiorgio Spagnolatti's response: "Chi dice che l'IT è un dungeon? Diciamo di chiamarlo 'il cervello del mondo', finché nessuno lo capisce." It plays on the idea of IT being like a dungeon but reframing it as the world's brain until people realize it.

I need to think of something similar. Maybe something that contrasts traditional views with a new perspective, using metaphors from finance or technology.

Perhaps something about data rivers or flows—since in finance, rivers are important for trade and money flow. In IT, data is like the river of information.

So, maybe: "Chi dice che i dati sono un fiume incontrollabile? Noi diciamo di governarli come una valle da minore." That translates to: Who says data is an untamed river? We say we manage it like a smaller valley. Or something along those lines.

Alternatively, think about how IT transforms data into insights, like turning mud into gold. But that might be too cliché.

Or use a financial metaphor: market trends are like tsunamis—powerful and unpredictable. So, "Chi dice che i mercati sono prevedibili? Noi diciamo che sono come tsunami inattesi."

Alternatively, using the idea of the brain: IT is the brain, making decisions faster than humans can think, so maybe something about speed or reflexes.

Wait, perhaps a quote that plays on the idea of IT as a system that can't be fully controlled but is essential. Like blood to a machine. Or the pulse of the system.

Hmm. Maybe "L'IT è il cuore che pulsa, ignorando chi lo guarda." The IT is the heartbeat, pumping regardless of observers.

But I want it to tie into something specific from the episode topics. Since they talk about automation tools and infrastructure, maybe something about how these tools are like gears or wheels in a machine.

Or use the term "data stream" as a river: "Chi dice che i flussi di dati sono incontrollabili? Noi diciamo di governarli come un fiume." Who says data streams are uncontrollable? We say we manage them like a river.

I think that's good. It ties into the flow of data and the idea of managing it, similar to how rivers are managed but are still natural elements.

"Chi dice che i flussi di dati sono incontrollabili? Noi diciamo di governarli come un fiume."
