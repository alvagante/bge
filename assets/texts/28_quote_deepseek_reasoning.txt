Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants a short, impactful quote in Italian based on the provided text. The quote needs to be memorable, punk-inspired, and concise—under 150 characters.

First, I need to distill the main themes from the episode. The key points are: SEO's evolution, content value, user engagement, video and influencer marketing, data privacy, and personal branding. The guests discussed how digital marketing is still vital but must adapt to new technologies and user behaviors.

Since it's punk and modern, the quote should have an edge. Maybe something about breaking rules or authenticity. The original text mentions that SEO isn't dead but evolves. Also, content must provide real value. Combining these ideas, perhaps something like "Il marketing digitale è un coltello: affilalo con contenuti o taglierà solo illusioni." (Digital marketing is a knife: sharpen it with content or it will only cut illusions.) That's 109 characters, fits the limit. It uses a metaphor, which is poetic, and the punk element comes from the sharp, edgy imagery. Checks all boxes: concise, memorable, metaphorical, and ties back to the content's importance as discussed.
