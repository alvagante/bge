Okay, I need to create a short, impactful quote based on the provided text about the evolving role of CTOs. The key points are the shift from technical focus to strategic leadership, balancing technology with human elements, continuous learning, and innovation. Let me brainstorm some metaphors or contrasts that capture this essence.

"Codice e cuore" contrasts the technical (code) with the human (heart). "Bruciando silicio e alimentando visioni" uses burning silicon (tech) and fueling visions (strategy). "Il CTO è l'alchimista del futuro" positions the CTO as a futurist alchemist, blending elements. "Trasforma bit in ponti, macchine in alleati" transforms bits into bridges (connecting tech and business) and machines into allies (humanizing tech). That's under 150 characters and hits the main themes: evolution, strategy, human element, innovation.

"Codice e cuore bruciando silicio e alimentando visioni: il CTO è l'alchimista del futuro, trasforma bit in ponti, macchine in alleati."
