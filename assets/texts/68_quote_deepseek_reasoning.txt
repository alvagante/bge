Okay, I need to create a short, impactful quote based on the provided text about Java's current state and future. The user wants something memorable, a bit punk, and from a modern poet's perspective. Let's break down the key points from the text first.

Java has a long history, starting in the 90s, with major updates up to version 21. It's still vital in enterprise environments, despite not being trendy. The ecosystem includes frameworks like Spring and Hibernate. There's mention of performance improvements, garbage collection, licensing changes, and future trends like functional programming and AI applications. The challenge is to encapsulate Java's enduring relevance and evolution in a punchy quote.

The quote needs to be under 150 characters. Let's focus on Java's resilience and evolution. Words like "veteran," "evolve," "roots," "code," "mutation," "future" come to mind. Maybe contrast its age with its adaptability. The punk element could be a metaphor like mutation or rebellion against obsolescence.

First draft: "Java: il veterano che si rinnova, radici nel codice, ali nel futuro." But it's too calm. Needs more edge. "Veteran" is good, but "mutation" or "mutates" adds a punk vibe. "Java muta, ma non implora: il codice antico forgia il futuro ribelle." Checks character count. Let's see: "Java muta, non implora: codice antico forgia il futuro ribelle." 82 characters. Captures evolution, refusal to beg (defiance), ancient code shaping a rebellious future. That's punk and poetic. Yes, that works.

"Java muta, non implora: codice antico forgia il futuro ribelle."
