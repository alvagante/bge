Okay, so I need to come up with a short citation based on the provided text. The user wants something memorable and impactful without any comments or author attribution. Let me read through the description again.

The text talks about ChatGPT's impact over two years, discussing AI evolution, practical applications, risks, ethical concerns, human-machine interaction, domestic robotics, environmental impact, local vs cloud models, changes in reality perception, real-time innovations, and future implications.

I should capture the essence of these points. Maybe something that reflects how AI has transformed various aspects of life while highlighting both benefits and challenges. It needs to be concise but vivid enough to stand out.

"ChatGPT ha trasformato il mondo con la sua potenza Intellegenziale, apportando nuove opportunità e rischi, lasciando il futuro al篇tozero."
