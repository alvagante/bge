Okay, I need to create a short, impactful quote in Italian based on the provided text. The user wants something memorable and punchy, with a modern, essential, and slightly punk poetic vibe. Let me start by reviewing the main points from the episode summary.

The event "It's Glowtime" didn't bring major innovations, focusing more on existing products and minor updates. There's criticism about Apple following the market rather than leading it, discussions on ecosystem development, health features in Apple Watch, AirPods improvements, AI integration, and reflections on hardware stagnation versus software growth. The future hopes for more innovation, especially in AR with Vision Pro, but it's seen as not yet impactful.

The key themes here are stagnation, incremental updates, ecosystem over innovation, and a call for Apple to lead again. The quote needs to encapsulate this sentiment concisely. Let's think of metaphors. "Glow" from the event title could be a play on words. Maybe something about light dimming or not shining as bright. Since Apple's known for "thinking different," maybe contrast that with following instead of leading.

Possible angles: Apple's light (innovation) fading, following instead of leading, ecosystem as a chain or web. Words like "luce" (light), "ombra" (shadow), "eco" (echo), "catene" (chains), "seguire" (follow), "innovazione" (innovation).

Trying a few combinations. How about: "Apple non accende rivoluzioni, ma custodisce l'eco di chi un giorno osò pensare diverso." (Apple doesn't ignite revolutions but guards the echo of those who once dared to think different.) Hmm, references their old slogan "Think Different" and implies they're just maintaining past glories.

Check character count. Let me count: "Apple non accende rivoluzioni, ma custodisce l'eco di chi un giorno osò pensare diverso." That's 91 characters. Under 150. It's poetic, uses metaphor, has a critical edge but still concise. The punk element is in the critique, challenging the status quo. The "osò" (dared) adds a touch of rebellion from the past, contrasting with current complacency. This seems to fit the brief. Let me make sure there's no author and it's just the text. Yes. I think this works.
