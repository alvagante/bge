Okay, I need to create a short, impactful quote based on the provided text about OSINT. The user wants something memorable and effective, with a modern, essential, and slightly punk vibe. Let me start by reviewing the main themes from the episode description.

The episode covers OSINT's use in gathering public information, ethical considerations, privacy, digital awareness, and the balance between technology's power and responsibility. Key points include the importance of methodology, critical thinking, legal limits, security implications, and the need for continuous education.

I should distill these ideas into a concise quote. Maybe something that contrasts the openness of information with the responsibility of using it. The punk element could be a rebellious twist on knowledge as power. Words like "arsenale" or "sovversiva" might fit. Let me play with the structure. How about "L'OSINT è l'arte di trasformare il visibile in verità: un arsenale di domande in un mondo che vende risposte." That's 140 characters. It captures transforming visible data into truth, using "arsenale" as a powerful metaphor, and contrasts with a world selling answers, hinting at critical thinking. The colon adds a punchy pause. Yeah, that works. Let me check the character count again to be sure.
