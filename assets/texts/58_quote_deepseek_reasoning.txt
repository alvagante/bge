Okay, so I need to create a brief invented quote based on the provided text. The user is an observer of the world, a modern deep poet, essential and a bit punk. They want something memorable and impactful without inventing the author. Just the quote in Italian.

Looking at the podcast description, it's about the evolution of the backend developer role from the early days of computing to today. It mentions origins and evolution, impact of emerging technologies like big data and AI, current roles, future trends, etc.

The response example given is a quote about programming being like writing poetry, each line a verse, each function a verse fitting into the previous one.

So I need something that captures the essence of backend development's evolution or the programmer's craft. Maybe something about how every line or function builds on the last, much like a poem.

Perhaps focus on the journey from simplicity to complexity, or the beauty in the code's structure. Maybe something about the balance between creativity and logic, or how each small part contributes to the whole.

I should make it concise and impactful, using metaphors related to art or creation since the user mentioned being a poet. Also, keep it in Italian as per instructions.
