Okay, so I need to come up with a citation based on the given text about the evolution of the backend engineer role. The user wants it to be memorable and impactful without assigning an author. Let me read through the provided information again.

The text talks about how the backend developer's role has evolved from the early days of informatics to today, touching on changes in interfaces, programming languages like Visual Basic transitioning to JavaScript and TypeScript, cloud computing with microservices, AI and ML integration, deployment practices, and future trends. It also mentions the importance of skills like architecture knowledge, DevOps collaboration, and continuous learning.

I need to capture all these elements in a concise citation that sounds natural and memorable. Maybe start by highlighting transformation or evolution since that's central. Then mention the key areas covered: from programming languages to cloud technologies and AI. Finally, wrap it up with future trends emphasizing adaptability and skills.

Putting it together, something like "The Evolution of Backend Engineers: From Programming Languages to Cloud Technologies, AI Integration, and Future-Proofing Their Skills." That covers all bases succinctly.

"La Transformación del Rol del Desarrollador de Backend: Del Lenguaje de Programación Inicial a las Técnicas de Microservicios, la Integración con la Inteligencia Artificial y las competencias Futuras."
