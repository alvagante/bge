**Piergiorgio Spagnolatti:**  
"Nonostante il cambio di gestione, VMware rimane la principale forza nel mondo della virtualizzazione. La comunità non deve preoccuparsi perché abbiamo un leader che sa dove va."

Alright, so I need to create a short invented quote based on the provided text. The user is an Italian observer, a modern, deep, essential, and slightly punk poet. They want something memorable and impactful without inventing the author; just the quote itself in Italian.

First, I'll read through the description and the content of the podcast episode to understand the context. It's about VMware after being acquired by Broadcom, discussing changes in licensing, distribution channels, products, and how it's causing agitation among users, clients, and partners. 

The guests mentioned are Piergiorgio Spagnolatti, Lino Telera, and Giulio Covacci. The response given is Piergiorgio saying that VMware remains the main force despite the change in management, and the community shouldn't worry because they have a leader who knows where it's going.

So, I need to create a quote that captures the essence of VMware's strength despite the acquisition. Maybe something about continuity or leadership in the virtualization world. Since the user wants it to be a bit punk, perhaps a bold statement.

I'll think of phrases like "L'innovazione non muore" (Innovation doesn't die), or emphasizing resilience and continuing to lead despite changes. It should resonate with the community's concerns about VMware's future under new ownership but also reassure them that VMware will remain strong.

Putting it together, something like: "Nonostante il cambiamento, VMware rimane l'anima della virtualizzazione. La comunità si ribella ma la leadership è ferma." (Despite the change, VMware remains the soul of virtualization. The community rebels but the leadership is firm.)

Alternatively, more concise and impactful: "VMware non muore, cambia" (VMware doesn't die, it changes). But maybe a bit too direct. Or "L'innovazione VMware è un tsunami che nessuno può fermare" (VMware innovation is a tsunami no one can stop), but that's more about innovation than leadership.

Considering the original response was about not worrying because the leader knows where to go, perhaps emphasizing leadership: "Con VMware, il futuro della virtualizzazione è in buone mani." (With VMware, the future of virtualization is in good hands.) But maybe a bit too generic.

Another angle could be the community's strength: "La comunità di VMware è più forte che mai. Nonostante i cambiamenti, rimaniamo uniti." (The VMware community is stronger than ever. Despite changes, we remain united.)

But since the user wants it to be a bit punk and memorable, maybe something edgy like: "VMware non si arrende nunca. La innovazione è la nostra forza." (VMware never gives up. Innovation is our strength.) 

I think combining elements of leadership and community resilience would work well. Let me try: "Nonostante il cambio di gestione, VMware rimane il faro della virtualizzazione. La comunità si fida nei nostri leader." (Despite the change in management, VMware remains the lighthouse of virtualization. The community trusts our leaders.)

But maybe too long for a quote. Shortening it: "VMware rimane il faro. La comunità si fida." (VMware remains the lighthouse. The community trusts.)

Alternatively, something more concise and impactful: "Nonostante tutto, VMware è vivo e vibrante. La comunità lo sostiene." (Despite everything, VMware is alive and vibrant. The community supports it.)

Considering the original response was about not worrying because the leader knows where to go, perhaps focus on that aspect: "Con VMware, il futuro è in mano esperta." (With VMware, the future is in expert hands.)

But I need to make sure it's an invented quote, not directly referencing the original response. Maybe something like: "VMware non muore, se continua a innovare." (VMware doesn't die if it continues to innovate.)

Alternatively, using a metaphor related to punk, like fire or rebellion: "VMware è la fiamma della virtualizzazione, che brucia più intensamente che mai." (VMware is the flame of virtualization, burning more intensely than ever.)

But perhaps too metaphorical. Maybe something about resilience: "Nonostante il cambiamento, VMware rimane resistente e forte." (Despite the change, VMware remains resilient and strong.)

I think the best approach is to capture the essence that VMware's leadership and community strength ensure its continued dominance despite changes. So, a quote like:

"VMware rimane il leader incontestato del mondo della virtualizzazione. La comunità si fida nei nostri leader che guidano con determinazione."

(VMware remains the uncontested leader in the world of virtualization. The community trusts our leaders who guide with determination.)

But maybe too formal for a punk quote. Alternatively, using a more edgy phrase: "VMware non muore, si evolve." (VMware doesn't die, it evolves.) This is concise and captures the idea that despite changes, VMware continues to thrive.

Yes, that works well.

"VMware non muore, si evolve."
