Okay, I need to create a short, impactful quote based on the given text. The user wants something memorable and effective, in the style of a modern, essential, and slightly punk poet. Let's start by analyzing the input.

The guests listed are Fabrizio Lodi, Igor Falcomat√†, and Marco Guardigli. The links provided are a piracy warning video and an Archive.org search for Fidonet. Fidonet is an old computer network, which makes me think of early internet days, perhaps a nod to digital culture or underground movements. The piracy warning link adds a rebellious or anti-establishment vibe.

Combining these elements: rebellion (piracy), old-school digital networks (Fidonet), and maybe the names of the guests as symbols or part of the metaphor. The quote needs to be concise, under 150 characters. Let's think of metaphors that merge technology with human elements.

"Fidonet" could be a metaphor for connections or veins. Piracy as rebellion. Maybe something like "Siamo Fidonet: vene digitali che piratano il domani." Translating: "We are Fidonet: digital veins pirating tomorrow." It uses Fidonet as a symbol of digital pathways, "pirating tomorrow" suggests stealing or shaping the future in a rebellious way. Check character count: "Siamo Fidonet: vene digitali che piratano il domani." That's 56 characters in Italian, well under 150. It ties the elements together, has a punk edge, and is memorable.

"Fidonet: vene digitali che piratano il domani. Ribelli coi modem accesi nel buio dei server spenti."
