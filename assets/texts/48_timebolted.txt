so you we are
episode the fourth year of lumber yard energy is being thin which is our way to say that their the dicks
first time we know it's in english and
first timer of your guests
i phone as we're going to talk about the camper
oh the commercial management camper but also the the cooler
the event
topics
around the these are crazy
can we say the box
you have their copyright on their work
i don't know we we talk about them outside our interactions i don't think many people
into the actions but i will let you do you're going to the action scene where you want
oh chris
oh chris chris the winner
they comfort my husband's tamp so that's one think
if there was a person were open source
on his arm it would be crisper either
combat
also to absorb enough problems because everything just faking the problem is is bored
he's been a country
for everything they op's conflict management open source for many years ago i do something
one thing with a q i don't do it
apart from that year
pretty good or for his management
the church come from
anyhow on who should or should i pick james was perfect
thanks for pointing to a somewhat
but ah
gibbs
and i'm really scared james
or you get from of a row home
h rico i think that the sun poacher
am talking about how to use fake goods
from discussion
and then we with
that's and sell them
or maybe morgan is when talking about probably the best name ever for a management job
like am and perhaps your budget
oh wow
madden camp
he's probably the most active over the years
and jumpy have the most contributions
give comments on the wednesday i think that's the basic cooking
like doing our best
yeah
it it was talking about pockets
it was why
i don't have a discussion anymore
i guess i
si para aware
patrick them
i have my town
it was fine
i didn't practice sorry
invitations to you know it you had your chance
for the surplus i didn't that
hospital after a cat for off the table
are you for having me let's go to their something
let's not
he cannot see because yeah magic
the scanner working is a is a dependable guy he's wearing hard working and i met him through conflict management camp and between haven for shaun actually between him and chris
this conference just really happen they they go through and worked so hard and it's the best conference i go to a year and throw a great writer to hear about so many different tours and we have many how it chats with which we make my own kids to makeovers human or you are smart people
hi we're doing as well
and for the actions
tosh
please do your choice to do adam or patrick
some drama and i don't need
after africa that's easier
so i presume most people know patrick already am but
he held a nickname our father got godfather of them up
the one who started their ups and and upstairs and together with stress of course am and he's very active on promoting them up
and the the spirit of it
i am and i just find a lot of people i think to adopt a lot of the theories that come with that lifting tenth so we do conflict management camping cant
well technically lives in the suburbs up camp but yes he lives close to a i am so i think that's a risk again think we do yes
think that's modern art linkletter day
the closest you can of all of us but you know a gym is exempt that off his award currently skilling camp leaving tomato leaving tomorrow at canada
okay
thanks for the productions
i mean produce you heat shield of mine
jacob
create over schaeffer creator
my
and whenever you have conferences where you can you see
you are
going to
something interesting but enough about the presentations and everything let's talk about the the topic
they could fish management campus data were the union your recent auction now was quick and amber's feel about these v know how it goes
we don't have official number skills we don't have to check in and see if there's people rant
but i do know that i think it was during arabs fought for a hobby for we had a standing room only in the room at three twenty six there was over many people sitting in the overflow room
there was still a lot of people are grabbing coffee
walking to the sponsors up the boots so at that point we know that we were closing in on fat chicks six the people
actually became more busy in the afternoon if we have pictures of people were complaining that they had a of them feeling atomic mass and them are there were a corporate jets in the womb at some point was are standing room only we had to move the observer
um
track because it was made in this forum so
i think people really happy that roger job from a jaguar discussion
we want them to vote
more of seven hundred people registered
rancho because they're not sure either on some of them just as of now i think once more for them
throw at a free conference about other people were coming
i guess
quite happy with that
some remarks were size
no so much
different to previous years we actually see more people come in the afternoon am of people shop actually let us am also people have come from fast them are more tired am even topic to start later
i am register numbers were the same as last year
i'm actually wednesday we had more people than last year's i think we we reach two hundred fifty which is something that's been never have have the far
i'm like richard m g m t still has a lot of people who who subscribed for the heck some i am but there on that many we have this problem on on wednesday
which were trying to figure out on on how to do petrus cancelling and purchased a room engagement
oh a lot of new paper right
so does every will be off during the opening how many people over there
for his farm and i think at that moment of of the room rate their hands on it was really surprising that for many people coming for an event that has been wanting for ten years for a very well not to forget that the or for floor room we have no idea how many people put up the handset so this brings me to my if you feel like a decaf if management
yes because otherwise
forty years and
someone else would you want to answer are catholic once launcher run away so on
mean it's both it was dramatically de france in that specific like the shape of people's infection and years ago in i was so you're and you're ready and prime probably from as people as i mean archery now well it's trending toward not sure which from a my max trade dead in a stuff like chef and
up ahead and see if and jan were bike were more like reading the edge darker nothing yet
right style couple years away a is for sure and ah thank rain
i think when he said offense any event the provision in space seven fisher scared to death things didn't exist yet they were coming back here rain and wake on earth chef and path header were all day and of like car provisioning share else am pets said if nasa and right i think on it now you see
either that chewing landscape like aware of it was evolutionary service microwave carry these ideas to new spaces right her reform take the ideas of a pet and chef and put them into provisioning stuff they debut as rain
and then you know darker and cuban eddie's and the rest of it for is disrupted the commercial aspect of that space which then didn't hurt them initially but then eventually sort of us media studies her a little or to me that thing that's changed mostly as their when we came in initially it it did feel like it was a sad if slightly despair
like communities and had some overlap that were i our now it doesn't go away or bag if you much more bake one large media of people who are interested maybe on different aspects of the conversation but they thought much more unified than they did ten years ago to me maybe has i ten years ago i was driving a wedge yeah i cannot think
was but were you know you are doing a new age so i hope not always easy i mean it's a good way yeah yeah
i don't know if at all and that's how it feels the terrestrial you but to me it feels it feels as much if your bike if you like the folks who bennett for ten years remain their cars they genuinely ever obey them of each other ends and ten years ago like we're pretty sure we liked each other but we're also kind of an hour and caps can remain we had like
a really strong points of view a bag very niche she issues were we so maybe have this bunch of you bet there's more where more that unites us that divides us was fatally it's almost like the there is an acceptance of saying well you know if that's your flavor that's right
you know if he if you want to do it by yam of out that's good you want to do it differently if you wanna go by coop and that's that's how it feels i think of another transition and might not be that feasible for a people attending of it my husband can put the chewing on the languages they're fully made an impact on organizations from a the proper perspective
things became more self service
oh legal use languages they could like it there was a policy around is how he got deployed
so it also left over the years little bit of the hard core system administrator who have to collect bootstrap audio for structure but there's an indication more on the application
but there's no way it's like another interesting riff on ad is there like i've said if things that we were attacking back for management camp only one of them i think you could call relatively pure can fit match by match melman yeah i had think it's basically james like everybody else is there some other ref that if you were looking at it in like a family tree
and you're like who is running down the family tree of like have like pure configuration management it's basically james m. ike that's interesting to where before there were only three or four of us all and different spiders of the tree and it's sort have collapsed where like the ones that we torture still around but none any real dreams of telling a new one has been for awhile and
the only new and that looks traditionally the same amethyst initiative can deal back on saturday
doesn't rain and i mean it does but get a look at it differently then i think you were market this reputation of the measurements are like the shape of an famous author
like if i have to jump in the
but so so for me like conflict management awarded the cleanup early stuff islands
agarwal warrant really wasn't from op ed know how many cannot shake my rogue you or oh man ago they got a frontier and even on but you know what away some of those original cried years a finger so correct am and i will they sent on a query a really really think that that the taco robe and companies and saw on the
i have a short attention span though i can figure and or or restoration of provisioning oh bit coin communities wherever you are more and i think there was was i was missing for me
i am i remember i was for your and of her early bit coin
i also had m g m t stuff going on there was like rohner just jump around i wanna hit one discipline and are really good at that a really big finish saw worth problem can avoid ferraro operates about one hundred percent because we have not done that you know even puppet either of our paper was finished by far
and if you have children
and they never wanted but those and core so i decided to sit down and read my to war but i why you know what i think he had some way i can tell you brush efforts are finished
that's very honest
a space
classic which one do
now and in the yes so i mean i don't see myself as classic hope i think the way i look like some of the court with holes but i think that and the future
i work for proving maps in the years were come yet there's that my space that did the trick is there has to be when when the starting position is that everything they came before you was done by dummies and there was nothing like know river and like that's bad tells you to doomed to reinvent so
some variation of wider things were great wealth like you know like what changes dang by i'm doing like but i thought attractive you are talking about i like we went looking at those things with out of the benefit of that history and that now i'm just mad and that time together ends be at birth
hunter gatherer at keeping measuring emperor or so you know surely together as people who explore the same field and you're reacting to each other and to the advancements of the fear of enter where you think is interesting and bike of course that only a matter of time before added that suit comes more stuff that has impacts in the world has it
really powerful things and it's incredibly interesting niche as technology and mike of course this can be more interesting stuff that's in the camera back and you know when we talk about a nice can pick management is the same way we talk about having existence demonstrators like everybody two cartons of the tab up sanjay and as i read the fucking systems administrator platform engineers as the of the shit
i did for the first academic career of all i did so like you know wherever common everyone so configuration as many at it after my purchase being thirty years i have a rough thrust and were rather try and catch up any comments but they usually say whether people ask me why we're doing is filled with if you think about the season
think about the war and overseas than smith lever for more than and that needs to be those who sees them and i guess there will be medic was invaded
the scales and more ammo
for any kind of people
i'm i'm i'm living a little bit more in the distance from america your like it do it's all a couple of the only choose it strikes me when i used to a or b. your see you at now like syntax to get a class system up and running like i don't get much out of he's probably all of them in this like you're a proton syntax sugar
wow so i feel for a while that was the stagnation on okay you know whatever language and be paid you like but then i personally was you know not because you were doing now and digit the twins but the concepts of that got me reagan i do it again okay this is poised on a new perspective
i just do your reasoning about that stuff
not just on what are you gonna do you root canal explorer
a client or something but you can bring costs calculations you can being in like several other considerations and and having this more in sync with your production we it as the women's that that i found very if like a noose park in there have you feel like maybe to round it off after i remarked i know you're excited about you
seen or as parks that cow like when oil was like okay with this is probably a new paradigm or something that makes you jump besides having a new language like that
that's how i feel if i am with you
the summer
an exercise fanatic is that where play whether i'd like zed ate it may have no idea yet i can access their creativity yeah well i am steal the finite the main that is configuration is like fun and terrifying experiments were have no idea what that actually were back like in a way that feel safe in ac and bike use also people that doesn't mean it's not gonna be used or
say if i think it they were become you swore never be unsafe but we don't have it and that's our beasley like an interesting spark i think the idea at like a universal configuration graph which are they really wanted to have like if if they were here bike like i remember why i first heard him tell me that when he was nothing but was a long fucking time ago you know
very rarely the his that bad idea i think his fans new life again in different forms she saving queue sit says miniature them have one way thinkers and there's can see more and more of that am i think with the choir dave imperative thing in the same way that we are felons are like convergence systems and then darker punched a found the face with a kangaroo
and was like he actually you know it's better is concurrent system dobbs and which we always knew is true but we had like as me anyway like shut it down the people who was bad idea and we're like your damages emergence forever and i think you can see a similar thing with the declared is moral period like i watched it
i'm really a day from the system initiate a team we can send a signal of such as trevor says to change a trace level and said it added in action it's it's finished is to use the u s session manager to send the signal distributed across the the poem and in production so they can tweak the chase my balls that the application and they it
hey i'm mike for you i'm to traverse appeared that doesn't work on it acquired of way read my comment you do i guess you will i guess she had bright at corner a declaration that says that arguable should be axed where the chase love of shit the axe by like or you can happen you care that i got track you care back side effect you care about the next thankful i think there's a lot not just in such machine but like
neither get my coat james is building nobody's ever top of the reacts with speed the changes that bag those lips were some much slower what can you go when it's if the media reacts at the speed there james is system reacts we have no idea rate so interesting and besides had a really interesting sparks a year for for army again is a drug
the good is my new marketing director of basically training one day my business partner oh se but firm
or say or new toys and things so when adnan a vast year year ago ways way if his first met in it or i think by the vaccine
for forever rhythm yeah but there was a few yeah okay there you go and you know i mean i can walk the stock pickers
for me as a guy who thinks about you know european butter or oil and pig mandarin you are new to reddit like the most exciting thing so we can i see a new to over there was another thing i was weighing one a few i were ever a my mortgage like you said it's dive in tennessee deeply what he's doing and for arabs case
first thing that stops me and i when i saw his talk in the more asked year was wide the gooey aspect of it and why i saw them in off on the i mean isn't that nice why i said oh my god a growing hate going to matter more
our to meet you
second thought was like holy shit his yourself so much of our customers that what goes on so
i got no money or so your heart
it seems like you know every new to probably try to get a new paradigm across right
the way of thinking that change
you're an old stuff
i think you have a choice to this point zero point
it's fuckin point like you cannot even as much another a new position we can catch you prefer i like oh mary does bypass from a fine you know like you can wear what like another configuration match will sit and watch roughly the same my pattern and shaughnessy a pension three reworked like okay and vinegar
had the do we need one but really you know my really without if a parent should think rain am like what's left to do right now is interesting is nothing or they're like if if it's not interesting why like what's the point we covered a lot of ground that has now become pretty tried and true so if you're not doing something interesting
that's why i think now is is so interesting at the moment in our movement because like it it did have or attack my the the sole i think where with like this it's still it's a should be a thing and like you study to see a be like oh yeah it definitely is still a tank has look rather interesting stuff that's on him happen help
but it takes a minute as you have to work hard to do better than we did we did a good job though like the sat trivial to make something better you know the we see any progress like like one gap with a scene when he gets like one is the deployment and do reactionary thing with observable deep but that might be you know canada
feedback loop you know and she and keys work here
the other one is an easy example i'm i'm a servant of our i need my function to be deployed i can't test everything locally i have this complex thing although it's the point is puff by the risen connection missing on might the burglar war kind of tracing in colour far
anything happening there in that region
see when they see them were intact
i had a hard time connecting the abstract way or maybe like because it uses abstract contracts and what the conflicts that i'm easy
but i think that's probably worth adding would certainly in attempts to head their whether he's get whether they're getting it and adds a different question
but like the may i think if they were if you advice here either jewish i did you read it so i i thought them ever he's trying a new car no way of this it in some ways it's called provisioning again i care reform but that he bundle them that other guess it's wings clipped her ticket esque thing
but i think that i honestly more like he stood in the corporate inside a nap
machine it's off reasoning and sarah palin and bachmann fan so i wonder if it's because it's too hot for the bose like why widen telephone book the buffet a runner a more i tell him it's any for him it's actually that the cloud is the operating system than his prevent you said he like like more on the frivolous and like the idea that you would have to configure history of rhetoric
that the erica yes you don't i think about a little arbor don't you think of people are enough for most customers now okay
if you know who you don't have to know what the databases and in a little what's what's happening with several it's in general like visceral it's remarks like when you get complicated tickets it's too complicated though it's great and so it's not and he's been a lower the level of complexity of that and we don't know
if you lower if he make it easier to build better architecture is that he removed the friction the comes with higher scale more complicated several attacks actors could they build bigger more complex applications in that style and it with rat that interesting that like well if you ask the teams debt debt dude several that's why they fail they fail because the kids too complicated and
and the management at the several of fifa and stretch to err on the productivity of using servers my christmas though if he can return hyperactivity camps you then suddenly that them they demand and that architecture michael up at which point you start to see some more complicated things that you couldn't have seen her consider for a because the framework that you were bike
back to pay off my cousin that's a that's a legitimate bad the good work am i'm not sure if the well i could and it's really interesting to see someone try and the simulator aspect that they packed a digital twins you know make that's like he's essentially building a digital and for the quiet battle of factions and marijuana actor they're in a sin your mirror children
waste they immigrated has been sweet which is super core and an interesting idea that you know i don't think patrick it hot the you are i had thought the you aren't rain fell like i just took a whole fucking crazy simulator
patrick spent years thinking about the newest rain
yeah it's worth a month and a funny thing to feather modeling i came from it from actually the virtual game engine thread through in they're they're giving a times in the industrial things and sinking knowledge so that was my ago
yeah i'm not i think that like never really took off but maybe know was i was expected that the cloud provisioning cooling let's let's go it like the system
comic moments that some extent words be clouded most no services like why am i know you can but i'm not seeing it pick up like put 'em on a google mail server were the main into certain conflict
poor my mail chimp or anything like any third party service it seems that those are still on the quick to be click while they're like from how legacy your view that that's hard to maintain as a conflict but i haven't seen it picked up you see like you're in there is like trying but
nowhere is picking the domain really like the problem
most of those appear as aren't very stable
i am so trying to do that is mostly a problem of ah let's let's take the domains so depending on which just you use you have different their appears the appears are not stable for does ah
registrar spit intrusions said becomes very difficult yes i know that's why it took two minutes
death through this so that's the reason why i've seen a lot of people tried to do that
come on you have a few open source projects which have actually tried to do that but tick chance to maintain it because of the instability of the appear and that's something i think the cloud providers have done much better slang g c p n n it up stared a prize or at least slightly more stable that you can manage
damn right they might be garbage but they're our changing garbage it's like
and and and that's a big gamble changing garbage is on is is something that's very difficult to maintain from an open source community perspective for people get excited make it and then the friend changes it's am sometimes but even gypsum advance notice if you're extremely lucky but most of the
i'm it will break in your user who get fed up and they run away and getting them back is difficult but i get that at for consumer services paper and to pretzels
and i do yeah i've seen some its into telephone you know i am and maybe i mean am bite but i don't think it's koran away the year describing ends i i honestly think aware of it is their their declared is the drift doesn't happen in the same way for her
this argument at the very beginning of configuration as bad as it think the you attack back a big match my cap with your shots my thought you know prettier the as a legend that coffee or in the top the as easy on the top one individual practitioners abed that this craft about i'm a fool if he were if you're a hall of fame and am i think personally it's top five zero
oh am back i put him on the map rushmore but like you do you even he's incredible and at the time like jenkins was everywhere everybody was setting up jenkins costas and we were all everybody was working really hard the are made the you like said a few junk and costa is code and heap and i remember him be i showed him how to do a chef and he
this is fucking dumb you know he was like you know what i can do you i can cook in this web you i men and jab runs ten thousand times and i don't want it to change in if i do you want to change i could just call them quicker and change ourselves kept on hit save and it's done and i think of any more for ten thousand more times
and we'd all be like well but what if he destroyed the jenkins cluster and what if the blah blah happened and he was like oh i'm not an idiot so i do my best not to delete the continuous integration infrastructure and i take back as to the database and i restore if i can help either staff has another shop and bike he just like harangued me for like an hour and a half ago when a dummy i was on
if there's something to do is point that pic when you look at i googled them and how often do you monkey around with your domain like are not that what is like beer with that the and as problems this is like an ongoing if you did that last there would be more step but you keep adding new features new services and they all meet the a nurse and then the whole milk
he was completely changed though everything if we have dinner with him and about unity and as main is definitely not something you'd that once and don't know for a year you keep on having my trainer my parents had hinted that barely
instead
yeah i know i see different things but you need to keep up with updated it's not something things if it's not nice
i think
some things but for other things
no sir smells like it existed for thier through seems like it exists for everybody that as an appraiser immigration make with a quickie i am i'm not saying that it's bad to do it the other way but before trying to figure out why it didn't happen said patrick's point it didn't happen be helps fundamentally it wasn't that big a problem like it wasn't that painful and were like
it's awful i have to hit us were like ended is the one time a year you married you in the header like once every decade he set it up in your like i was bad but like i get punches that rules the do a bunch animation and like it's fine like geez of the cuts through it it's fine if if the check out when a way i could recreate them that's
true i think i agree we have to the mainframe paper who enough family given their first pronunciation at conflict management camp
and we had them actually a dump to lob of the configuration management tools we have
wow these people who traditionally a very slow and moving
the slowest movies are of course i b m i and even they are moving to configuration management okay are about twenty five thirty years late but they still are moving towards that so
the attitude of many of these enterprise customers who previously would have liked click really cranked to increase is moving towards different they're moving is of course extremely slow am takes them typically fifty years to catch 'em put at least there's some movement there so i think if we're were going on here
okay good
pick a commercial think before they catch it yes
and him they have than the advantage of having tooling that is more stable and more mature because bring most of us have seen lord of the changes in configuration management they will come in at a point where it's much more stable and a chart and maybe that would be beneficial to them
ten years to get a book ready yes yes sir alan's comments as current nice one makes me think about like the design of t v i p because that the provost the security or one problem here is the the i p packet than the t c be accurate or went to the ones one mapping m c amp like
have the t speak election move to different i p like chewing a am an annoying like how i the border in reception oil we have the database server on the web server error was like just fake you it up once it's done but i don't think that the our future infrastructure and given our current infrastructure is moreover avoid we express
these dynamic parents as white individual through walls like work auto stewing and fear or and things like that a wife for me the whole realization that we won a moral i'm game than a question of how do we have moral time instead of these tariq systems and that's why both the my wine woods or added i
i'm excited to hopefully become a mature for we can start throwing out this is one over toward the just manage one aspect the time so i the the poor or or skewers
the cost a man's to of like orgy melinda from the old days i always wanna bes when it's it's a throw them out and just replace all that with cool code in in something
way in know kids every time we have a different war the the daily interfaces bitcoin between east war become harder to manage you can moreover horses the mother or you can i check the horses members or and as our our infrastructure in early come invariably become more complex off by what i was on and
i peers
taker a why you know there's her or zone zona whatever so this is what i'm working for its i mean to be contrarian for a minute and a we say that we've moved to a world where everything is like more ephemeral and portable in reality that's now what's happening even in a world where were you on it that way like
it's freaking me that way because the tooling forces inside the conversation a couple at hand the consumers may have a people with there like work the way we deploy is we did we start with clothing a new cabinet faster and then we move all the data into that costa and then we deprecating augusta and you're like why is that the way you're doing and and i'm like well be has cuban had
is doesn't i prayed didn't play very well and we have our to think that knows how to reconcile the we just keeps growing more and more reconciliation the if a problem and so on so overdone done not actually looking at that problem in any kind of in through any lens of rational thought if you were rationally dragging our feet if we remove the thickness
you can already chosen and we said just sit down at the pizza paper draw me the structure know that now
now that is the is he wouldn't do it they would take forever for you it rather architecture and when you drew it your friends with laugh at you they'd be like that's insane like every you i had the poor and diverse in that thing you can destroy the back wayne new like yak good hygiene ha you do you like know like the ah for a nike so i i think that we're with
a what their cells into this parks where we were like hey because this because these ideas were good declared a reconciliation lives you know what's community is except appeared in chef weathered with a moved a reconciliation look inside the thing with the manifest in reconciliation bill brands in go does the thing that needs to do you on the jurors like it's essentially
the same para and that we were running indeed if on as before it does it and ends dead and and nothing if not cool or you swore bad is it that fine of days of how we actually want these systems to work were even apparent you wanna embrace for how long an hour and know i can but rather see it written james's way for you both like
that's a much more interesting bad semi am because the shape of the underlying systems changes the shape of where you can go back up with amp this is why so many crippling eddie's attractions fails to be attracted the raw right they just completely week when it is underneath them because that the her face itself it's so i love anyway there's more there's a whole untapped interesting
vein in that assumption that says that those architectures were good or even to be desired a nap sure that they are am i used to be sure that they are but i trained my mind away your peers and though these complexity which we try to hide under the easy to some
on the surface sometimes you know when you think about the obsession with ever we're measuring it an interface with the innocent babies at the end of it i have some real tools the summit the eyes of some worker sometimes don't work as expected sometimes becca and so on a i wonder if
i think you would be hilarious
simplify things for them use
tough
oh wait for the complexities
i with me sometimes when i see some to try to do looks like magic
that magic and it going in the real world know how to love so easy
i think the danger is over promising with your abstract rape obstructing i wouldn't take the bet her turn is lives you to king can we don't think about the machine learning and straighten the mischief somewhere stuff and stuff like that for you and i can't like my yeah yeah
i am and the will kind of abstraction so it doesn't make sense of where one among the trial i just use the service okay whether that's the enough there's something else like i don't meet you look in there and it does the job right
that like okay somebody taking care of this perk i can do the job i have begun to see i can come to the expression so i think you know what we learned come over the years of the abstractions is that when you fail and you don't have the insides you not prepared anymore and there's the whole thing about okay if
he was thrown off policy like okay
you have you all see i see the pipeline working read but what if you haven't trained how it works to anybody that would be a mess so we we need to compensate somehow that we are prepared for a failure we still on this them with her documentation but we can't escape this complexity of the abstraction when if
of like an eye to eye with my car i do when it fails i got the grades they have the tools and that's i i don't need all the tools my garage but i do think it allows us to go faster
areas because it's taking care of well that's the most efficient way
if it's things up like seven to any this was just you just make sure that i can do the hell overall not like the most efficient way
don't care because we don't see and somebody of picture that and if that's a good price and watch for me
third of the cooperation of of a trust with the party that you're going for
trust and in their respective they tell you what's going on the tell you the changes something you also mentioned that have another way of dealing with the complexity of abstraction
yeah
that level of and hank factory rain select a certain age have comforting as it is isn't there is an irresistible level i think they the danger of attraction there one said patrick's point the i'm like that are dangerous in and the south is that they cannot be pierced easily by design bike meat when
when we talk about attraction think the assailants i were intentional usually making those attractions nap years ago in usually senator behaviour of what's underneath weeks which slavic or them with they all factions really key to some degree that's why so another mark purchased think that's under explored is that this nation if like a semantic layer that
there's there's we can think of it it's have the world works like you know what city were having a conversation must have if you're sitting at desks
we have thought about the atoms that make the desk a desk even know their stuff and my estimate thick layer of the world where they arent the molecules that make up the desk are true but the real that's a true thing but it's their be discovered desk because they were easy at are paid a high level of phonetics and at the lower level of ethics and we haven't really embrace that idea in
i think about harry observed systems that scale semantic way as a thirsty cheater attraction rate so bad we make it so you know patrick kane ours is a perfect one like at brackets the drive the car
you don't need a lower level of semantic attraction the understand all the parts of the car the mechanic does the mechanic cares you know when when when a car that's hard to work on comes any like a hideous fucking cars is their math that that low level phonetic attraction of the carnage to be water and in general what we tended do in infrastructure especially people who don't
haven't worked in infrastructure those tools and and pressure for on time they tend to really just be like war abstract all of this way it's all useless mark none of it matters just only gives us given given the think they need and nothing more and it never works because that lower layer of semantic abstraction is the war is necessary we habit because
sometimes you need it and instead i question of harry you scale semantic way i think it's a question is an untapped vein as a thinking about system sign and his or circle level of standardization so i remember when to the there was no
i can't have access to my client or anymore and you remember or with weeks with you you don't need like aw man i work in my viewers you don't need so you standardized with the interface is good enough were through the that constant drive to from a fiber go under the hood and throwing your standard
the the irony is is if i'm very close to the technology of a person it seems that i hear about all the north's if i'm buying computer i'm looking up all the specs i need to know and then when it's a car unlike fowler thrive or good but i can't like a so i don't need it but it's because i care about and i know
from her if you were involved that meet you know but we don't that's how also standardization until you do yes yes if you do you do anything if you leave the divas digress
the coroner allergy mean we're getting to a point where cars and dragons or for future level but at some point they cannot and then there's people there of young people were gonna not even be able to rubbish if you could the netherlands and can expect cause to drive and things completely open while they don't have a
crack at some point because something happened there wasn't a good go through a red white and her mother can can realize that because she looks up and they won't understand that or it rips why this because of their neighborhoods and that's what we're seeing now with new technology to people spring up you posters and have no clue to their this kinda eat somewhere then again and floor and what i do
oh and it's a disgrace and you'll need to fit those road traffic went that's what his ability and feedback loops and they are all of that if your mother and the need to find ways to your people i remember back it's about magic remember monitoring you need to disarm you need to somehow can figure this and those students to the courts have all the blink rate the chorus
although thing because they fit
fix supper things but even there it's not so do i think we have a lot of to do so you out the widespread gallagher make a pro an me like batman and and harper carrigan
the time you want to join us
married single while had a majority of it now you
perhaps the one time for spread you actually at your leisure
i mean unless i'm it's been a your with the middle of
i really miss you a parent were like most of the time when i saw to attack like as people are like ma which maybe have you that's real you can't buy like mad sure i actually i go to your it give the morrow morals
oh you don't want drawn by them
or cameron very funny
thanks
okay so better way to david and says going gary
sending messages on the chart which you school interesting
smoke
how can we see the chap
go ahead and was underlying the other is the way
said we see since a semantic layer themselves
so you don't have to care about how they work
until egress
because when the feedback were excellent the direction interface breaks to start
is when the big deal if i'm patrick i know that you are a jam pay the full faith in you
yeah i
a in the patience
let's talk about these are not for the operations of the eye for the moment which is awesome
an aggressive talking about a high and operations so this won't be and course if the which i guess everybody's grieving over about using a window
chooses to our i'll pass
oh do you see
goldberg
now i think the firm so you have a few drinks we had a op's was was basically looking at this pic for a galaxy and trying to seduce what is the next thing you're trend that be looking for
among op's for training the balls we're a while i marks for tree watch one will morals and and now work or look into jenny i and towards an affair with the alarms how they can help each other 'em
there's the third world in general fine information can get a lot easier and a lot more in context so we feel i took a mutation if we feed our wiki if you feel like your or run box in a way to when we need it will surface
quite easily that's cover were using mixing around dara with the last line was more that's when that's true documentation wherever that's your business you ask if it's something we can do well with new technology
patrick saying of this or is the i hold him hostage again
a blank well i have no trace for having x p a reef small i say you might know
so apart from the declaration are people have been looking into of course january we could that is pin trial and error and we're trying to make this in a better way of craving tests were not there yet but it is just keyboard tray
i took a beretta or at least reduce the burden of a screening those tests
improving you could have and then there's no thing about the what if he can delegate is to and agents that just peripherals what you're doing what somebody else is doing an axe on our behalf
ignoring that could be set of just saying how do i generally a web page with the newest framework just start coding me some of the file what i've said if in order of maturity first thing a framing the quotation that's kinda like it
saw a problem generating could be know how to do it we just need a lot more training
in there but go further trusting if were not there yet so i'm i'm trying to sue my interested to see what the boundary is like how how do we get better how can we make sure that when it's assisting us and what cases weakened automate some of those
and an interesting of the hof ferman pick things comes up there is wow biggest express what you warn you this crap what the comic fall is doing and it makes a link on this on the semantic luck
this caliber hope that this war further evolve as the mongols get better better trains are instead way i am actually my co my talked earth like will i trusted currently no speeds certain areas of 'em and what we can do without 'em an actress
the economical for i keep hearing
call situation again
communication is important
this as fast as possible
china has changed
see this guy just that i also want somebody to look at what's the customer who is impact of information
easily get and
just it for me
decisions while i'm fixing
can help there
fixing things known cases comedy yes and then it's manner of okay here we go for it
but i know it it's like
dismiss this as
it's the next technology and it for hype
thank you
i'm just trying to understand its limits right now and it's it's almost like this
i hope together
yeah i think the limits are moving almost every day
oh and and then murphy world
we were year ago not able to run in a big day
are currently running on a laptop with similar quality jobs that's a huge impact on been now can run some of that stuff and accounts
just say it go so fast and nobody really knows what it's also immersion behavior of that stuff
it's it's so hard about it
i say
okay that's
and if i give hints at it all begins i don't need to programme anymore it becomes like it's it's exercising behavior that otherwise would have been
to go
and anyway
work on getting better tests and observing to make sure that you're not cheating
which is something i've been advocating is wow that were saying let's run the script on on the machine so we can get panel and and the irony is that been very good at this chaotic saying and were also dealing with things the production
you still have a fail safe environments on that stuff so it doesn't go away body can go up faster and digest information just a lot faster than that can help but i have i live here
but i would watch the required and you know which the smart people on you
to be in a ranch
my kids not area
no problem
thank you
so
now that we have left
some questions for back to camp
take the case
a bit year
do you want to do
next year
universally for doing at your house university
ties
really
measuring maybe trying to do something for the top or retrospective yeah yeah
prospects and
c
we'll try to announce some the it's love that shown us and and move forward and a bit quicker
puts for now
also have heard that patrick just class
panic something out
but this year and pretty much can be busy with that
some were of september
camper canada
maybe before long
that's the thing
yes that can happen in this year
both next to each other i mean from an organisation or point of view
the main focus for pretty other a fan till september and then we will again scanner conflict management camp but it should be the same place same time
fourth and fifth of september
location belgium
look at christmas background and new shit know where locations
the location my background is the location were only it's luck of you mean wanna
that's for sure
but to really tell you if i'm not falling
we are planning the fifteenth anniversary party
it's been fifteen years since very first dating again
i am working on getting that rolling
for the first week of september if you're asking a crappy man on camera yeah i'm forty four to get off to be the year anniversary of them
talk about it for mean
nobody belgium
okay
i mean i'm a mother
yeah but we have a problem because of the champ addition
share an immature
oh bring them so that the current fourth creation of the ten year anniversary
probably go there is such for a former in touch it basically says you know
we need to find something else
guess we'll we'll be there a couple of days
i am so sick and vacation for one hundred yours
message me shame if change
looking for money to build them g m p
our vacation for from richer
i love that aspect
you will have it all
last couple of weeks ago
it's pretty impressive fifteen years since
and family and kick ass off i mean he's he's traded franchise that you know one of the biggest franchises in the warm and there's really not a a company and the overall doing serious computing is not a least cock ups for a huge portion of the time
it's just after the year under rocks map know what sir patrick and i won't have dogs
one day we'll do that a box
a car from engineering
the show
you already have already explained that fight
the only thing i did my comment
copy it stop and i think my post
i will report post office box the job five
summary question quite so what do we call these people and i think it would look like shape or form it's being good at their job and clothing platforms for ages
the organization you go get the
i think there's nothing you into doing up it's still the same job though being around people consume where it's an extra one
where are you're running a softer of the surface of the path for mobile rings
shopping carts mean you're building things that are people consume and you need to collaborate on you that's path for engineering is that system administration just people who keep awards on get people from those meet
and it doesn't matter what you call
i want you reading
that's a lot of us think of it
engineer job title which is always
because it's to that time
is also true that people use it as a joke
i do and
any somewhere
kind of bears which that those things and knows about those things out on a shot
the scandal
the elements
it's a glass keep and finally i ask the thinking some time ago about
the job title
engineering is why not
somehow
who knows how to do these kind of things but guess
it's our opinions invaded the thing you describe if somebody actually uses that description that's fine before we had an initial hobbies are we still have now is the people put different expectations
up there wasn't a java engineer who also the system administration they want the system engineer who also is capable of debugging stacked races and while those people either that know that a mirror
there is the fourth what is obscene junior when you look for it are you looking for a developer who took your operation apart or are you looking for somebody who have a proper job experience and of automation it's it's not clear the words creates of a more confusion than clarity on the part that you sometimes have
a bunch of engineers are you
medvedev obscene sit between the theme and
also
and the developers ambiguity
are you doing
let's not talk about box
but scholars engineering
call it together it's a common set of values
chief
means that the
the company
get confused about what think it is
that's mostly for their foods
no this is a row of engineer
here is a personal choice
the parts
i'd rather have somebody who's having four
for much more clear
to destroy your organization is actually looking for them
looking for
it's absolutely adore than before
i mean
absolutely
note
no clue
first you
depends on the context arm
and and typically and of oxygen you would not be and could title because you in the real to spirit you would want to have someone who has some development and some operations or who can switch between the two complexes and that's not something that most people can do
that's the same problem but that's just naming am creating more silos his is a more problematic issue where by you you have the votes ingenious talking to each other over different silos and then you start wondering what are they trying to achieve here
cloud of meanings
somehow they box
he doesn't help
whenever he said idea what it is now
these days since the beginning seen them explaining
in the same reason that the if you as you think we're so different people
semantic now suppose
okay a before we leave were a heavy close so sir james's to leave
and go to sleep
anyone have any idea what seems as you want to communicate and share with the world so plateau platform camp italy
can you were in the summer
the sprinkler before springer or three some voila
oh yeah and there's there's any
the best for was
the best the most elegant the location
in the thigh
now i'm joking have other life because there was these you remember that least nowadays
hi women were we were all in san francisco i think he was perfect
on probably for maybe a dress code at the venue and i think the people who go all the be traveling they were coming straight from
the purpose of a just coming straight from italy
and they would basically be okay pack for sure to be sure that
three and a guy coming for you
chicken breast
it's orbit eventually led us to break the rules
we have for me at least why the staff but there was one the foot was placed in okay so guys
you for your participation
thanks to the last month
there we are easily is afflicted by was kind to name as they don't understand would work
yeah those so gary says and many jobs as no one is looks to hire an imperative
exactly they want the deaf and the op's and everything together
i do have the budget
for one person here
and the match
as paid us are you your matter be better in every
if anyone out there listening is are working to contribute to an empty or be on a customer we have some freedom use cases on the cheap flag but in such an empty can take up a ping me and have some software
garcia para where my hospital after that a fantastic of alike
a guy
not so bad thank you for that
he's
oh see you next time the best
i wanna thank you
