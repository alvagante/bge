Okay, I need to create a short, impactful quote based on the provided text. Let me start by understanding the main themes. The event discussed cybersecurity challenges, AI's dual role as a tool and a threat, the importance of human interaction, and community collaboration. The quote needs to be concise, memorable, and a bit punk.

Hmm, combining the fragility of human elements with the coldness of technology. Maybe something about circuits having vulnerabilities but humans having firewalls. Wait, "firewalls" is a cybersecurity term. "Anime" adds a poetic touch. Let me check the character count. "Nelle vene dei circuiti scorrono vulnerabilità, ma solo le anime ribelli costruiscono firewall." That's 113 characters. Perfect. It captures the blend of tech and human spirit, essential for cybersecurity's future.
