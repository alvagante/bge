Okay, I need to create a short, impactful quote based on the provided text. The user wants something memorable, in the style of a modern, essential, and slightly punk poet. The topic is Ansible vs Puppet and their relevance in Infrastructure as Code.

First, I should focus on the key themes from the text: automation, code as infrastructure, the debate between tools, and the evolution of technology. The guests discuss whether these tools still make sense and who uses them. The quote needs to capture the essence of choosing tools pragmatically rather than dogmatically.

The original text mentions that the tools implement Infrastructure as Code, save time, reduce errors, and adapt to cloud computing. The quote should be catchy and concise, under 150 characters. Maybe something about code being the real infrastructure, dismissing the tool debate. Using metaphors related to construction or punk could add edge.

Let me brainstorm some phrases. "Code is the real infrastructure" is a strong start. Then contrast Ansible and Puppet, but dismiss the debate. Maybe "Code is the real infrastructure. Ansible or Puppet? The scaffold is temporary, the blueprint eternal." But that's a bit long. Need to shorten. "Scaffold fades, code remains." Maybe: "Code is the true scaffold. Tools rust, automation thrives." Hmm.

Alternatively, use a punk vibe with words like "rust", "anarchy", "machines". But keep it professional. The quote should be profound yet punchy. How about: "In the anarchic symphony of servers, only the code's whisper endures. Ansible? Puppet? Just strings to the maestro." Too long.

Wait, the user said "brevissima" so very short. Let's try: "Code is the true infrastructure. Tools are just punk chords in the symphony of automation." That's 114 characters. Maybe better. Or "Automation is punk: disrupt with code, not debates. Ansible, Puppetâ€”tools fade, scripts remain." 135 characters. That's under 150. It combines the punk element with the message that the tools themselves are less important than the code/automation.

Alternatively, "Infrastructure as code: where Ansible and Puppet are just brushes. The canvas is eternal." 102 chars. Hmm. Or more edgy: "Debate tools? Code is the rebellion. Automate anarchically." 63 chars. But maybe too vague.

The original discussion questions if these tools are still relevant. So the quote should imply that beyond the tools, the code and automation principles matter. Maybe: "Beyond Ansible vs Puppet lies the real battle: code against chaos." 94 chars. That's good. But does it capture the essence of Infrastructure as Code?

Alternatively, "In the cathedral of automation, we pray with code. Tools are but transient hymns." 104 chars. Mixing religious metaphor with punk? Maybe not. The user mentioned "un po' punk", so maybe more rebellious. "Automate with the fury of code. Let tools be the silent rebels." 92 chars.

Wait, the user wants something memorable and effective. Let's think of something like "Code is law. Tools are its anarchic enforcers." 66 chars. Or "Scripts scream louder than tools. Automate, then obliterate the debate." 92 chars. Maybe that's too aggressive.

Looking back, the key points are Infrastructure as Code, automation benefits, tool evolution, and the debate's irrelevance. The quote needs to highlight that the code is what's important, not the tool. Maybe: "Tools rust, code remains. Automate the revolution." 61 chars. That's concise, punkish, and on message. "Rust" as a metaphor for obsolescence, "revolution" ties to punk. Yes, this works.

"Tools rust, code remains. Automate the revolution."
