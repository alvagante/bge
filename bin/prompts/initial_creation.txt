I have to make a Jekyll site that will be hosted on Github Pages.

The site will be about the podcast "La Brigata dei Geek Estinti".

The site will have the following sections:

- Home (with the latest episode and a link to the podcast page)
- Episodes
- Guests
- Hosts
- Tags
- About

The markdown files for each episode will have the following information:

- Title
- Description
- Date
- Duration
- File (with the link to the audio file)
- You Tube ID
- Tags (with the tags of the episode)
- Guests (array with the guests of the episode)
- Host (with the name of the host of the episode)

The site will be made with Jekyll, using a theme which fits the podcast.

I have to create the site using the command line and the Github API.

Please, be very specific in the instructions, providing commands and all the needed files.
