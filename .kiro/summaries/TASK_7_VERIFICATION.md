# Task 7 Implementation Verification

## Task: Implement pipeline orchestrator

### Sub-tasks Completed:

#### ✅ 1. Create PipelineResult dataclass in src/orchestrator.py
- **Location**: `src/orchestrator.py` lines 16-82
- **Implementation**: 
  - Created `PipelineResult` dataclass with all required fields
  - Added properties: `duration`, `success_rate`
  - Implemented `get_summary()` method for human-readable output
  - Includes detailed error reporting

#### ✅ 2. Implement PipelineOrchestrator class
- **Location**: `src/orchestrator.py` lines 85-450
- **Implementation**:
  - Main orchestrator class with `run()` method
  - Coordinates extraction, generation, and publishing
  - Proper initialization of all components

#### ✅ 3. Add method to initialize enabled publishers
- **Location**: `_init_publishers()` method (lines 185-220)
- **Implementation**:
  - Initializes publishers based on configuration
  - Authenticates with each platform
  - Handles initialization errors gracefully
  - Logs success/failure for each publisher

#### ✅ 4. Implement episode processing logic: extract → generate → publish
- **Location**: `_process_episode()` method (lines 330-410)
- **Implementation**:
  - Extracts episode data
  - Generates images for each platform
  - Publishes to enabled platforms
  - Collects results and errors


#### ✅ 5. Add support for processing single episode, multiple episodes, or all episodes
- **Location**: `run()` method and `_extract_episodes()` method (lines 107-270)
- **Implementation**:
  - `episode_numbers` parameter accepts:
    - `None` for all episodes
    - List of specific episode numbers
  - `_extract_episodes()` handles both cases
  - Proper logging for each scenario

#### ✅ 6. Implement platform filtering
- **Location**: `_determine_platforms()` method (lines 290-328)
- **Implementation**:
  - Accepts optional `platforms` parameter
  - Validates requested platforms against configuration
  - Returns list of valid platforms to process
  - Logs warnings for invalid platforms

#### ✅ 7. Add dry-run mode
- **Location**: `run()` method and `_process_episode()` method
- **Implementation**:
  - `dry_run` parameter in `run()` method
  - When enabled, generates images but skips actual publishing
  - Creates mock PublishResult objects for dry-run
  - Logs "[DRY RUN]" prefix for clarity

#### ✅ 8. Implement error collection and summary reporting
- **Location**: `EpisodeResult` dataclass and `PipelineResult.get_summary()`
- **Implementation**:
  - `EpisodeResult` collects errors per episode
  - `PipelineResult` aggregates all results
  - `get_summary()` provides formatted report with:
    - Duration, success rate
    - Image generation statistics
    - Publishing statistics
    - Detailed error list

#### ✅ 9. Add logging for each pipeline stage
- **Location**: Throughout orchestrator.py
- **Implementation**:
  - Logs at pipeline start with configuration
  - Logs episode extraction progress
  - Logs image generation for each platform
  - Logs publishing attempts and results
  - Logs final summary
  - Uses appropriate log levels (INFO, WARNING, ERROR)

## Requirements Coverage:

### ✅ Requirement 6.1: Logging
- All operations logged to console and file
- Appropriate log levels used throughout

### ✅ Requirement 6.2: Error handling with context
- Errors logged with episode number and operation
- Stack traces included for debugging
- Errors collected in results

### ✅ Requirement 6.3: Continue processing after non-fatal errors
- Pipeline continues processing remaining episodes after errors
- Individual episode failures don't stop the pipeline
- All errors collected and reported at the end

### ✅ Requirement 6.6: Summary reporting
- Comprehensive summary with statistics
- Processed episodes count
- Generated images count
- Published posts count
- Detailed error list

## Additional Features Implemented:

1. **EpisodeResult dataclass**: Tracks per-episode results
2. **Publisher factory method**: `_create_publisher()` for dynamic publisher instantiation
3. **Comprehensive error handling**: Try-catch blocks at all critical points
4. **Progress logging**: Clear indication of pipeline progress
5. **Flexible configuration**: Supports various execution modes

## Testing:

- ✅ Module compiles without syntax errors
- ✅ All imports are correct
- ✅ Dataclasses properly defined with all required fields
- ✅ Methods have proper signatures matching design document

## Files Created:

1. `src/orchestrator.py` - Main implementation (450+ lines)
2. `test_orchestrator.py` - Comprehensive test suite
3. `test_orchestrator_simple.py` - Simple structure test
4. `TASK_7_VERIFICATION.md` - This verification document

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

All sub-tasks have been implemented according to the requirements and design specifications.
