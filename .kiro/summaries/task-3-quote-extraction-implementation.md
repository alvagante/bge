# Task 3: Quote Extraction Module Implementation

**Date:** 2025-06-10  
**Task:** Implement quote extraction module  
**Status:** ✅ Completed

## Summary

Successfully implemented the quote extraction module for the BGE Social Quote Generator. The module extracts quotes and episode metadata from markdown files with YAML frontmatter and supports fallback to separate text files.

## Files Created

1. **social-quote-generator/src/extractors/__init__.py**
   - Module initialization with exports

2. **social-quote-generator/src/extractors/base.py**
   - `EpisodeQuote` dataclass with all episode metadata fields
   - Properties for formatted output (youtube_url, formatted_guests, formatted_tags)

3. **social-quote-generator/src/extractors/quote_extractor.py**
   - `QuoteExtractor` class with full extraction logic
   - YAML frontmatter parsing using python-frontmatter library
   - Quote source selection (claude, openai, deepseek, llama, random)
   - Fallback mechanism to load quotes from assets/texts/ directory
   - Error handling for missing or malformed files
   - Methods to extract single episode or all episodes

4. **social-quote-generator/test_quote_extractor.py**
   - Comprehensive test suite
   - Tests for single episode, multiple episodes, and all episodes extraction
   - Tests for different quote source preferences

## Key Features Implemented

### Quote Source Selection
- Supports preferred source configuration (claude, openai, deepseek, llama)
- Implements fallback chain when preferred source is unavailable
- Random selection mode that picks from available sources
- Tries frontmatter first, then falls back to separate text files

### Data Extraction
- Parses YAML frontmatter from episode markdown files
- Extracts all required fields: title, guests, date, youtube_id, tags, etc.
- Handles optional fields with sensible defaults
- Validates and normalizes data types (ensures lists, strings, etc.)

### Error Handling
- Graceful handling of missing episode files
- Logging for malformed YAML or missing quotes
- Continues processing after non-fatal errors
- Detailed error messages with context

### File Fallback Mechanism
- Checks frontmatter fields (quote_claude, quote_openai, etc.)
- Falls back to separate text files: `{episode}_quote_{source}.txt`
- Cleans up quotes (removes extra whitespace and quote marks)

## Test Results

All tests passed successfully:
- ✅ Single Episode extraction
- ✅ Multiple Episodes extraction (5 episodes)
- ✅ All Episodes extraction (97 episodes found)
- ✅ Quote Sources (tested all 4 sources + random)

### Quote Source Distribution
All 97 episodes successfully extracted with quotes from Claude as the preferred source.

## Dependencies Added

- `python-frontmatter==1.1.0` - For parsing YAML frontmatter from markdown files

## Requirements Satisfied

- ✅ 1.1: Read episode metadata from _episodes directory
- ✅ 1.2: Extract quotes from YAML frontmatter and separate text files
- ✅ 1.3: Support selecting specific quote source or random selection
- ✅ 1.4: Log warnings and skip episodes with missing/malformed data
- ✅ 1.5: Extract quotes for specific episode when episode number specified
- ✅ 1.6: Capture associated metadata (episode number, title, guests, date, etc.)

## Usage Example

```python
from src.config import Config
from src.extractors import QuoteExtractor

# Load configuration
config = Config("config/config.yaml")

# Create extractor
extractor = QuoteExtractor(config)

# Extract single episode
episode = extractor.extract_episode("1")
print(f"Quote: {episode.quote}")
print(f"Source: {episode.quote_source}")

# Extract all episodes
episodes = extractor.extract_all_episodes()
print(f"Extracted {len(episodes)} episodes")
```

## Notes

- The module integrates seamlessly with the existing Config class
- Logging is implemented throughout for debugging and monitoring
- The code follows Python best practices with type hints and docstrings
- All edge cases are handled (missing files, malformed data, empty quotes)
