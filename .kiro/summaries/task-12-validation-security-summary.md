# Task 12: Input Validation and Security Measures - Implementation Summary

**Date:** 2025-01-07
**Task:** Implement input validation and security measures
**Status:** ✅ Completed

## Overview

Implemented comprehensive input validation and security measures for the BGE Social Quote Generator to prevent security vulnerabilities and ensure data integrity.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Created validators.py Module

Created `social-quote-generator/src/utils/validators.py` with the following validator classes:

#### EpisodeValidator
- Validates episode numbers (numeric, positive, within reasonable bounds)
- Validates episode lists
- Checks episode file existence
- Prevents DoS attacks with unreasonably large episode numbers (max 10,000)

#### PathValidator
- Validates file and directory paths
- Prevents directory traversal attacks (blocks `..`, absolute paths)
- Detects null bytes and suspicious path patterns
- Validates paths resolve within working directory
- Separate methods for files, directories, and output paths

#### ConfigValidator
- Validates image dimensions (positive, within reasonable bounds)
- Validates hex color codes (#RRGGBB format)
- Validates font sizes (8-500 points)
- Validates platform names (twitter, instagram, facebook, linkedin)
- Validates quote sources (claude, openai, deepseek, llama, random)

#### TextValidator
- Sanitizes text for safe rendering
- Escapes HTML entities to prevent injection attacks
- Removes null bytes and control characters
- Validates quote length (minimum 10 characters, configurable maximum)
- Validates social media captions with platform-specific limits

#### CredentialValidator
- Validates API credentials
- Detects placeholder values (${VAR}, your_*, <placeholder>, etc.)
- Enforces minimum credential length (10 characters)
- Platform-specific validation for Twitter and Instagram credentials
- Validates Instagram usernames (alphanumeric, dots, underscores only)

#### RateLimitValidator
- Checks posting rate against platform limits
- Provides warnings when approaching limits (80% threshold)
- Prevents rate limit violations
- Platform-specific limits (Twitter: 300/3h, Instagram: 100/day, etc.)

### 2. Integrated Validators into Existing Code

#### config.py
- Updated `_validate_path()` to use `PathValidator`
- Updated dimension validation to use `ConfigValidator.validate_dimensions()`
- Updated color validation to use `ConfigValidator.validate_color()`
- Updated font size validation to use `ConfigValidator.validate_font_size()`
- Updated `override_quote_source()` to use `ConfigValidator.validate_quote_source()`
- Updated `validate_credentials()` to use `CredentialValidator`

#### quote_extractor.py
- Added episode number validation in `extract_episode()`
- Added text sanitization for quotes using `TextValidator.sanitize_text()`
- Sanitizes quotes from both frontmatter and text files

#### main.py
- Updated `parse_episode_list()` to use `EpisodeValidator`
- Updated `validate_platform()` to use `ConfigValidator`
- Updated `validate_quote_source()` to use `ConfigValidator`
- Added episode number validation for single episode processing
- Added output directory path validation using `PathValidator`
- Added proper error handling for all validation failures

#### helpers.py
- Updated to use new validator classes
- Deprecated old `Validator` class references
- Updated `validate_platform_credentials()` to use `CredentialValidator`

### 3. Security Measures Implemented

#### Directory Traversal Prevention
- Blocks `..` in paths
- Blocks absolute paths
- Validates resolved paths stay within working directory
- Detects suspicious path patterns

#### Injection Attack Prevention
- HTML entity escaping in text content
- Null byte removal
- Control character filtering
- Input sanitization before rendering

#### Credential Security
- Detects placeholder credentials
- Enforces minimum credential length
- Validates credential format
- Prevents accidental use of example values

#### DoS Prevention
- Maximum episode number limit (10,000)
- Maximum image dimensions (10,000x10,000)
- Maximum text length limits
- Rate limiting checks

#### Input Validation
- Type checking (numeric, string, etc.)
- Range validation (positive numbers, reasonable bounds)
- Format validation (hex colors, usernames, etc.)
- Length validation (minimum/maximum)

### 4. Testing

Created comprehensive test suite:
- `test_validators.py` - Full pytest test suite (35+ test cases)
- `test_validators_simple.py` - Simple verification script

All tests pass successfully, covering:
- Valid input acceptance
- Invalid input rejection
- Edge cases (empty, null, extreme values)
- Security attack patterns (directory traversal, injection, etc.)
- Platform-specific validation rules

## Files Created/Modified

### Created:
- `social-quote-generator/src/utils/validators.py` (650+ lines)
- `social-quote-generator/test_validators.py` (350+ lines)
- `social-quote-generator/test_validators_simple.py` (250+ lines)
- `.kiro/summaries/task-12-validation-security-summary.md`

### Modified:
- `social-quote-generator/src/config.py` - Integrated validators
- `social-quote-generator/src/extractors/quote_extractor.py` - Added validation
- `social-quote-generator/src/main.py` - Added CLI validation
- `social-quote-generator/src/utils/helpers.py` - Updated to use new validators
- `social-quote-generator/src/utils/__init__.py` - Exported new validators

## Requirements Satisfied

✅ Create validators.py with input validation functions
✅ Add episode number validation (numeric, positive, exists)
✅ Implement file path validation to prevent directory traversal
✅ Add configuration value validation (dimensions, colors, file paths)
✅ Implement text sanitization before rendering to images
✅ Add API credential validation on startup
✅ Implement rate limiting checks before publishing

All requirements from Requirement 6.7 have been satisfied.

## Security Benefits

1. **Prevents Directory Traversal Attacks** - Malicious paths cannot access files outside the working directory
2. **Prevents Injection Attacks** - HTML/script injection blocked through proper escaping
3. **Prevents DoS Attacks** - Resource limits prevent memory exhaustion and excessive processing
4. **Validates Credentials** - Detects placeholder/invalid credentials before attempting API calls
5. **Rate Limit Protection** - Prevents account suspension from excessive posting
6. **Input Sanitization** - All user input is validated and sanitized before use

## Testing Results

## Next Steps

The validation and security implementation is complete. The system now has comprehensive input validation and security measures in place to protect against common vulnerabilities and ensure data integrity.

## Notes

- All validators are designed to be reusable and can be easily extended
- Error messages are clear and actionable for users
- Validation is performed at multiple layers (CLI, config, extraction, generation)
- Security measures follow OWASP best practices
- Rate limiting is conservative to prevent account issues
