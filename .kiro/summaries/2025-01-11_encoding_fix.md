# Encoding Fix Summary

**Date:** 2025-01-11  
**Task:** Fix character encoding issues in episode quotes

## Problem

Episode quotes contained encoding issues that were being rendered incorrectly in social media images:

1. **Hex escape sequences** like `\xE8`, `\xF9`, `\xE0` appearing instead of proper Italian characters (è, ù, à)
2. **HTML entities** like `&#x27;` appearing instead of apostrophes in generated images

### Examples

- Episode 17: `\xE8` instead of `è` in "L'open source non è solo un codice"
- Episode 8: `&#x27;` appearing in images instead of apostrophes

## Solution

### 1. Fixed YAML Frontmatter (98 files)

Created and ran `fix_encoding.py` script that:
- Converted all hex escape sequences to proper UTF-8 characters
- Mapped common Italian characters:
  - `\xE8` → `è`
  - `\xE9` → `é`
  - `\xE0` → `à`
  - `\xF2` → `ò`
  - `\xF9` → `ù`
  - `\xEC` → `ì`
  - And uppercase variants

**Result:** All 98 episode files in `_episodes/` were updated with proper UTF-8 encoding.

### 2. Fixed Quote Extractor

Modified `social-quote-generator/src/bge_social_quote_generator/utils/validators.py`:

**Before:**
```python
# Escape HTML entities to prevent injection
text = html.escape(text)
```

**After:**
```python
# Unescape any HTML entities that might be present
# (e.g., from previous processing or YAML parsing)
text = html.unescape(text)
```

**Rationale:** The quotes are used for image generation, not HTML rendering. HTML entities would appear literally in images (e.g., `&#x27;` instead of `'`). The `html.escape()` was converting apostrophes to entities, causing the display issue.

## Verification

Tested with episodes 8 and 17:
- ✓ All quotes display proper Italian characters (è, à, ù, etc.)
- ✓ No HTML entities (`&#x27;`, `&apos;`, etc.) in extracted quotes
- ✓ Apostrophes render correctly

## Files Modified

1. `_episodes/*.md` (98 files) - Fixed hex escape sequences
2. `social-quote-generator/src/bge_social_quote_generator/utils/validators.py` - Changed HTML escaping to unescaping
3. `fix_encoding.py` - Created utility script for batch fixing
4. `test_quote_fix.py` - Created test script for verification

## Impact

- Social media quote images will now display proper Italian characters
- No more `&#x27;` or other HTML entities in generated images
- Improved readability and professionalism of social media content
