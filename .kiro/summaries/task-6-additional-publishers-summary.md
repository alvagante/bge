# Task 6: Additional Social Media Publishers - Implementation Summary

**Date:** 2025-06-10
**Task:** Implement additional social media publishers (Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn)
**Status:** Completed

## Overview

Implemented three additional social media publishers following the same pattern as the Twitter publisher, with platform-specific authentication, error handling, and retry logic.

## Files Created

### 1. Instagram Publisher (`src/publishers/instagram_publisher.py`)
- **Library:** instagrapi
- **Authentication:** Username/password with optional session file caching
- **Features:**
  - Session persistence to avoid repeated logins
  - Support for 2FA and challenge verification detection
  - Caption length validation (2,200 character limit)
  - Retry logic with exponential backoff for transient errors
  - Detailed error messages for common authentication issues

### 2. Facebook Publisher (`src/publishers/facebook_publisher.py`)
- **Library:** facebook-sdk
- **Authentication:** Page Access Token
- **Features:**
  - Automatic page ID retrieval from token if not configured
  - Permission validation and helpful error messages
  - Caption length warning (5,000+ characters)
  - Retry logic with exponential backoff
  - Support for posting to Facebook Pages

### 3. LinkedIn Publisher (`src/publishers/linkedin_publisher.py`)
- **Library:** requests (direct API calls)
- **Authentication:** OAuth 2.0 access token
- **Features:**
  - Three-step upload process (register, upload binary, create post)
  - Person URN retrieval for authenticated user
  - Caption length validation (3,000 character limit)
  - Retry logic with exponential backoff
  - Detailed error messages for permissions and rate limits
  - Support for public visibility posts

## Files Modified

### 1. `src/publishers/__init__.py`
- Added exports for InstagramPublisher, FacebookPublisher, and LinkedInPublisher
- Updated __all__ list

### 2. `requirements.txt`
- Added facebook-sdk>=3.1.0
- Added requests>=2.31.0 (for LinkedIn API)

## Implementation Details

### Common Features Across All Publishers

1. **Error Handling:**
   - FileNotFoundError for missing images
   - ValueError for configuration/validation errors
   - Platform-specific exceptions with helpful messages
   - Graceful error recovery with detailed logging

2. **Retry Logic:**
   - Uses tenacity library for exponential backoff
   - 3 retry attempts for transient errors
   - Wait times: 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s (exponential)
   - Logs retry attempts at WARNING level

3. **Dry-Run Support:**
   - All publishers support dry-run mode
   - Generates captions without publishing
   - Returns success with "[DRY RUN - not published]" URL

4. **Caption Generation:**
   - Inherits from BasePublisher
   - Uses platform-specific templates
   - Includes hashtag generation
   - Validates caption length per platform

### Platform-Specific Considerations

#### Instagram
- **Challenge:** Instagram's aggressive anti-bot measures
- **Solution:** Session file caching to reduce login frequency
- **Note:** May require manual verification for new accounts

#### Facebook
- **Challenge:** Requires Page Access Token, not User Access Token
- **Solution:** Clear error messages guiding users to correct token type
- **Note:** Needs 'pages_manage_posts' permission

#### LinkedIn
- **Challenge:** Complex multi-step upload process
- **Solution:** Implemented three-step workflow (register → upload → post)
- **Note:** Requires 'w_member_social' OAuth permission

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Unit Tests:**
   - Mock API calls for each publisher
   - Test authentication with valid/invalid credentials
   - Test caption generation and length validation
   - Test retry logic with simulated failures

2. **Integration Tests:**
   - Test with actual API credentials (in CI/CD with secrets)
   - Verify image upload and post creation
   - Test dry-run mode
   - Verify error handling with invalid images

3. **Manual Testing:**
   - Test each platform with real credentials
   - Verify post URLs are correct
   - Check image quality and caption formatting
   - Test with various quote lengths

## Configuration Requirements

Each platform requires specific credentials in the configuration:

### Instagram
```yaml
instagram:
  enabled: true
  username: "${INSTAGRAM_USERNAME}"
  password: "${INSTAGRAM_PASSWORD}"
  session_file: "output/.instagram_session"  # Optional
```

### Facebook
```yaml
facebook:
  enabled: true
  access_token: "${FACEBOOK_ACCESS_TOKEN}"
  page_id: "${FACEBOOK_PAGE_ID}"  # Optional if token includes it
```

### LinkedIn
```yaml
linkedin:
  enabled: true
  access_token: "${LINKEDIN_ACCESS_TOKEN}"
```

## Requirements Satisfied

✅ **3.1** - Support posting to multiple social media platforms (Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn)
✅ **3.2** - Platform-specific API credentials stored securely in environment variables
✅ **3.3** - Include generated image and caption with episode information
✅ **3.4** - Include relevant hashtags in captions
✅ **3.5** - Log errors with details and continue processing
✅ **3.8** - Implement exponential backoff and retry logic for rate limits

## Next Steps

The following tasks remain in the implementation plan:
- Task 7: Implement pipeline orchestrator
- Task 8: Implement logging and error handling utilities
- Task 9: Implement CLI interface
- Task 10: Create default templates and assets
- Task 11: Write comprehensive README documentation
- Task 12: Implement input validation and security measures
- Task 13-14: Write unit and integration tests (optional)
- Task 15: Final integration and polish

## Notes

- All publishers follow the same interface defined in BasePublisher
- Error messages are designed to be helpful and actionable
- Retry logic helps handle transient network issues
- Dry-run mode allows testing without actual posting
- Session/token caching reduces API calls and rate limiting issues
